To the notifying party
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:        Case No COMP/M.4059 – Swiss Re / General Electric Insurance Solutions
                Notification of 15.03.2006 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                No 139/20041
1.     On 15.03.2006, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
       pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (“Merger Regulation”) by
       which the undertaking Swiss Reinsurance Company (“Swiss Re”, Switzerland) acquires
       within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation sole control of a
       substantial part of the direct insurance and reinsurance businesses of General Electric
       Company (“GE IS”, USA) by way of purchase of shares and assets.
2.     After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the operation
       falls within the scope of Merger Regulation and does not raise serious doubts as to its
       compatibility with the common market and the EEA agreement.

I.    THE PARTIES
3.   Swiss Re is active in the supply of traditional reinsurance services, both life and non-
     life (general) reinsurance. It also provides, to a lesser extent, direct non-life insurance
     services, via various subsidiaries. Furthermore Swiss Re is active in the direct life
     insurance sector in the UK, the Netherlands and the USA.
4.   GE IS is active in the supply of traditional reinsurance services – both life and non-life
     (general) – throughout the world. It also supplies direct non-life insurance in the USA
     and, to a lesser extent, in Europe and Canada. It does not supply direct life insurance.
II.  THE OPERATION AND CONCENTRATION
5.   Pursuant to the transaction agreement Swiss Re will acquire the shares of GE Insurance
     Solutions Corporation, which is a holding company for over 50 subsidiaries as well as
     assets of certain operations. After completion of the transaction Swiss Re will be the
     sole owner of GE IS and Swiss Re will have sole control over the business of GE IS
     and the transaction therefore constitutes a concentration according to Article 3 (1) (b)
     of the Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6.   The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more
     than EUR 5 billion (Swiss Re: 20,996 million Euro; GE IS: […] million Euro)2. Each of
     them have a Community-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (Swiss Re: […]
     million Euro; GE IS: […] million Euro), but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of
     their aggregate Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The
     notified operation therefore has a Community dimension.
IV. COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
7.   The concentration leads to an affected market for aviation reinsurance on a worldwide
     basis ([10-20]%).
     Reinsurance
     Product market
8.   The parties submit that the product market for the provision of reinsurance should be
     regarded as a single relevant product market covering the provision of reinsurance for
     all classes of risk. A reinsurer covering risks of a particular class may readily and
     quickly switch capital and resources from that class of cover to a different class of
     cover. In addition there are a large number of reinsurers active in the market, supplying
     reinsurance in respect of a wide range of classes of risk.
9.   In its previous decisions the Commission has decided that the market for reinsurance is
     a market separate from direct insurance because of its purpose of spreading risks
     between insurers and due to a different regulatory framework3. The Commission also
2   Turnover calculated in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Merger Regulation and the Commission Notice
    on the calculation of turnover (OJ C66, 2.3.1998, p25).

                                                         2

    considered whether reinsurance could be further divided into separate markets for the
    coverage of life and non-life risks4. Furthermore it considered sub-markets for the
    coverage of different classes of non-life risks (e.g. property, liability, motor and
    marine) although a final market definition was left open5.
10. In the present case it can be left open whether the product market for reinsurance has to
    be further divided into subcategories as no competition concerns arise even under the
    narrowest product market definition considered.
    Geographic market
11. The parties submit that reinsurance is a global business, with most of the top 35
    reinsurers writing risks across a range of geographical regions. In previous decisions
    the Commission has confirmed that the market for reinsurance is global due to the need
    to pool risks on a worldwide basis6. As there is no indication that the geographic
    market is different in the present case, a global market for reinsurance is considered.
    Competitive assessment
12. On a worldwide market for reinsurance (life and non-life) the combined market share
    of the parties amounted to [0-10]% in 2004 (Swiss Re [0-10]%; GE IS [0-10]%). In the
    EEA the combined market share would be [0-10]% (Swiss Re [0-10]%; GE IS [0-
    10]%). The main competitors on this product market are Munich Re, Berkshire
    Hathaway Group, Hannover Re and Lloyd´s of London.
13. On a worldwide market for life reinsurance the combined market share of the parties
    would be [10-20]% in 2004 (Swiss Re [10-20]%; GE IS [0-10]%) and on a worldwide
    market for non-life reinsurance the combined market share would be [0-10]% in 2004
    (Swiss Re [0-10]%; GE IS [0-10]%). On an EEA wide market the combined market
    shares would be [0-10]% (Swiss Re [0-10]%; GE IS [0-10]%) on the market for life
    reinsurance and [0-10]% on the market for non-life insurance (Swiss Re [0-10]%; GE
    IS [0-10]%).
14. If worldwide markets for reinsurance according to classes of risks were defined, the
    parties would have a combined market share of less than 15% in any of the following
    submarkets: Accident ([0-10]%); Health ([0-10]%); Liability ([5-15]%); Motor ([0-
    10]%); Property ([5-15]%); Marine ([5-15]%).
15. With regard to the segment aerospace reinsurance the parties estimate that the
    combined market share would amount to [10-20]% (Swiss Re [0-10]%; GE IS [10-
    20]%) on a worldwide basis and [10-20]% (Swiss Re [0-10]%; GE IS [10-20]%) on an
    EEA-wide level. The parties face competition from competitors active on a worldwide
    basis with substantial market shares, i.e. Berkshire Hathaway ([10-20]%), Munich Re
    ([10-20]%), Allianz ([0-10]%), AIG ([0-10]%), ACE ([0-10]%) and Hannover Re ([0-
    10]%).

5  See Cases IV/M.1150 Schweizer Rück / NCM para 7, IV/M. 1017 Hannover Re / Skania, para 6 and

                                                    3

16. Therefore, the transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the
    common market or a substantial part of it.
    Direct insurance
    Product market
17. In previous decisions, the Commission has distinguished between the provision of life
    insurances and non-life insurances. Within the life and the non-life insurance business,
    the Commission has held that these segments could be divided into as many product
    markets as there are different kinds of risks covered (e.g. accident, liability, property,
    motor, marine and aerospace which could be further subdivided7 into airline, airports,
    general aviation, hull, war/terrorism, satellite/space) since from a demand-side
    perspective no insurance of a specific risk is substitutable for the customer with the
    insurance of another type of risk8. It was, moreover, suggested that it might be
    necessary to divide non-life insurance products into private and commercial
    insurances9.
18. For the non-life insurance segment, the Commission has, however, also acknowledged
    that a sufficient degree of supply-side substitutability might exist between some of the
    individual non-life insurances. The exact market definition was left open10.
19. In the present case the parties´ activities are only overlapping with regard to the
    provision of non-life insurances. However, the exact product market definition as
    regards the provision of non-life insurances can be left open since no competition
    problems arise under any product market definition considered.
    Geographic market
20. In past decisions, the Commission has mostly defined the markets as national as far as
    life and non-life insurance products for private customers were involved. With respect
    to non-life insurance products for business customers, the possibility of a geographic
    scope wider than national was considered11, in particular for the insurance of very large
    risks, as they occur for example in the field of aerospace where the market was
    considered to be at least EEA wide12. There is no indication that the geographic market
    is different in the present case. The possible market for aerospace insurance and its
    possible submarkets are considered to be at least EEA-wide.

21. The combined market shares of the parties on the non-life segment of the direct
    insurance sector with and without direct aerospace insurance are well below 15% at the
    world, EEA and national level.
22. The combined market shares of the parties on the direct insurance markets for liability
    and marine are also below 15% at the world, EEA and national level. The transaction
    only leads to overlaps in the direct insurance markets for liability and marine in the UK
    and Spain, for liability in France and Italy, and for marine in Germany, Netherlands
    and Norway. On any of these markets for direct insurance for liability and marine the
    combined market share of the parties remains below 1% respectively.
23. Furthermore the parties´ activities overlap on the market for direct aerospace
    insurance. On a worldwide and an EEA-wide market for direct aerospace insurance the
    combined market share of the parties would be respectively [0-10]% and [0-10]%.
    Main competitors of the parties are Lloyd´s, GAUM, AIG, La Réunion Aerienne,
    Allianz and AXA. In any submarket of direct aerospace insurance considered, i.e.
    airline, airports, general aviation, hull, war/terrorism, satellite/space the combined
    market shares of the parties remain below 15% on an EEA-wide level and not more
    than 5% on a worldwide level or the parties´ activities do not overlap13.
24. For the sake of completeness even on a national level the combined market shares of
    the parties in the market for direct aerospace insurance remain below 15% in any
    Member State except for Greece and Ireland. In Greece Swiss Re has a market share of
    [15-25]%, but the parties´ activities do not overlap as GE IS is not active in this
    country. As regards Ireland the combined market share of the parties is [15-25]%
    (Swiss Re [0-10]%; GE IS [10-20]%).
25. Therefore, in any of the direct insurance markets or any submarkets considered the
    transaction does not lead to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common
    market or a substantial part of it.
V.   CONCLUSION
26. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
    Regulation (EC) No 139/2004.
