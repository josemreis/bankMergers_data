        Management S.à.r.l. ("EQT", Luxembourg) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b)
        of the Merger Regulation control of the whole of Curaeos Holding B.V. ("Curaeos
        Holding", the Netherlands), by way of purchase of shares.3
2.      The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
        <U+F02D>     for EQT: investment fund making investments primarily in Northern and Continental
              Europe.
