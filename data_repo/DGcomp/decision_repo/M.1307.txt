                          COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
                                                                          Brussels, 23.10.1998
                                                                              PUBLIC VERSION
                                                                             MERGER PROCEDURE
                                                                           ARTICLE 6(1)(b) DECISION
                                                                         To the notifying parties:
Dear Sirs,
Subject: Case No IV/M.1307 – Marsh&McLennan / Sedgwick
              Notification of 22 October 1998 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation No
              4064/89
1.     On 22 October 1998, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
       concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 by
       which Marsh&McLennan Companies Inc. (“Marsh&McLennan”) will acquire within
       the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation control of the whole of
       Sedgwick Group plc (“Sedgwick”) by way of purchase of the Sedgwick’s entire share
       capital.
2.     After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
       operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 and does
       not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and with the
       EEA Agreement.
I.      THE PARTIES' ACTIVITIES AND THE OPERATION
3.     Marsh&McLennan is an international professional services group with activities in
       the following fields: insurance and reinsurance distribution, insurance underwriting
       management, investment management, human resources consulting, risk finance
       insurance consultancy and economic and management consultancy.
       Marsh&McLennan carries out its insurance distribution activities through its
       subsidiary J&H Marsh&McLennan Inc. and its subsidiaries. The consulting side of
       Marsh&McLennan’s business is conducted through the Mercer Consulting Group
       Inc. and its subsidiaries. Marsh&McLennan is also involved in investment
       management through its subsidiary Putnam Investments Inc.

Telephone: exchange 299.11.11
Telex: COMEU B 21877. Telegraphic address: COMEUR Brussels.

4.    The principal activities of Sedgwick are in two main areas: insurance and reinsurance
      distribution, and employee benefits consulting.                     Insurance and reinsurance
      distribution consists of advising on and placing (re)insurance across a range of risks
      world-wide and is carried out through the company’s Sedgwick Limited operating
      division. Sedgwick’s employee benefits consulting business is conducted through
      Sedgwick Noble Lowndes and, as far as outsourcing of related services is concerned,
      through Sedgwick Limited.
5.    The notified operation consists of a public offer by Marsh&McLennan to acquire the
      whole of the issued and to be issued share capital of Sedgwick. The offer has the
      agreement of the board of Sedgwick who have recommended that Sedgwick’s
      security holders accept the offer. After completion Sedgwick will be a wholly-
      owned subsidiary of Marsh&McLennan.
II.    COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6.    Marsh&McLennan and Sedgwick have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover in
      excess of ECU 5,000 million (Marsh&McLennan, ECU 5,298 million; and Sedgwick,
      ECU 1,408 million ). Each of them has a Community-wide turnover in excess of
      ECU 250 million                 (Marsh&McLennan, [… ]1; and Sedgwick, [… ]1).
      Marsh&McLennan do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate
      Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified
      operation therefore has a Community dimension, but does not constitute a
      cooperation case under the EEA Agreement, pursuant to Article 57 of that
      Agreement.
III. RELEVANT MARKETS
7.    The parties activities overlap in the areas of insurance and reinsurance distribution
      and human resources consulting.
Insurance distribution
Relevant Product Markets
8.    Both parties are active as insurance brokers. They define the relevant product
      market as the market for the distribution of insurance services in general, comprising
      distribution by direct writers, tied agents and intermediaries such as banks and
      brokers. The distribution of insurance involves procuring insurance cover for
      individual and corporate customers2.
9.    A distinction can be made between the distribution of life and non-life insurance, as
      different providers tend to be involved and the distribution of life insurance in Europe
      is regulated separately from other types of insurance. The present analysis will focus
      on the distribution of non-life insurance since the parties have considerably less
      significant activities with respect to life insurance distribution.
1   Deleted. Business secrets.
2   Insurance distribution can also involve the placement of insurance on behalf of customers of other
    providers, where one provider considers that the other can better meet the client’s requirements.
    Given that the parties submit [… ], this aspect will not be pursued further.
                                                     2

10. The parties claim that the insurance distribution market should not be segmented
    further on the basis of the distribution channels (brokers and other insurance
    distributors), the type of product (the risk insured and the insurance cover provided)
    or client size (individuals, small/medium-sized and large clients).
11. According to the parties, a range of providers compete to distribute insurance cover
    to end customers and can therefore be considered as operating in the same market,
    i.e. brokers such as the parties, other types of intermediary such as insurance agents
    and banks, tied agents of insurers and insurers writing direct. The parties argue that
    all these providers are contesting the same customers and competing to supply the
    same product, i.e. insurance cover. Customers throughout Europe are prepared to
    look to underwriters dealing direct, brokers or others to provide the cover they
    require, and are prepared to switch between different types of provider where they
    believe they will get better value for money elsewhere. Coverage by direct writers is
    being increasingly facilitated by new computer and electronic communication
    technology which makes it easier to deal with clients directly, and allows clients to
    select the best deal themselves. Also, various banks and other financial institutions
    are distributing all lines of insurance to personal and commercial customers.
12. In a recent decision3, the Commission considered activities of brokers to be different
    from those of (re)insurers. The latter market their own products and have a vested
    commercial interest in selling these products to their clients, whereas brokers act as
    intermediaries between (re)insurers and clients, acting on their clients’ behalf and
    seeking to place their clients’risk with the most suitable and competitive insurers.
13. From a demand-side perspective, the market investigation has confirmed that
    corporate customers clearly distinguish between the kind of services they can procure
    from a broker on the one hand and from direct dealing insurers or insurance agents
    on the other. Brokers are perceived as acting in the client’s interest while
    underwriters are seen to act in their own profit interest. Brokers’ services are
    requested where independent advice is needed. Moreover, the range of services
    which large corporate customers, and to a lesser degree medium-sized and even
    small companies, seek from brokers normally goes beyond the actual placement of
    insurance cover. This range of services may include an array of ancillary services
    which can be tailored to meet the client’s needs, such as identification and assessment
    of risk, independent risk management advice, security rating of insurers, insurance
    market intelligence, independent actuarial services and claims support. From the
    point of view of corporate customers, underwriters dealing direct or insurance agents
    are not able to provide these services to the same degree and cannot therefore fully
    substitute brokers. Although some larger corporate customers are using brokers as
    well as placing business directly with insurers, they are nonetheless conscious of the
    different services provided by brokers and insurers.
14. In contrast, other intermediaries are becoming increasingly viable competitors for
    traditional insurance brokers. Certain merchant banks already maintain insurance
    consultancy and underwriting operations. There are indications that accounting firms
    are recruiting insurance brokers in order to be able to compete in the provision of
    risk management consultancy and services. Therefore, corporate customers might
3  Decision of 24 August 1998 in Case No IV/M.1280 – KKR/Willis Coroon
                                               3

    increasingly be able to substitute brokers’ services, as described above, with those of
    other intermediaries.
15. From a supply-side perspective, the market investigation has provided evidence that
    brokers have a more complete range of skills to advise comprehensively on the best
    products across the whole insurance market and to provide services ancillary to
    broking.
16. The market investigation also indicated that a further distinction could be made
    between the provision of broking services to commercial customers on the one hand
    and to private customers (including possibly small businesses presenting
    straightforward risk coverage needs) on the other. Brokers normally provide a
    different kind of service to commercial customers (i.e. broking as well as an array of
    associated services) and private clients (just placement of insurance cover). Broking
    services to private customers are therefore more easily substitutable by direct dealing
    insurers, insurance agents or other intermediaries. Accordingly, private clients are
    more likely than commercial clients to switch to direct sellers. Even in those
    Member States where brokers have traditionally been the preferred means of
    distribution, direct sale to consumers, for instance through mass marketing and
    telesales, would seem to be becoming an increasingly widespread form of distribution
    for certain classes of insurance, e.g. private motor insurance or household insurance.
    This penetration of the market by direct sellers is at the expense of brokers’ market
    shares.
17. Moreover, third parties have indicated that commercial broking should be further
    segmented by client size, in that large corporations and multinationals prefer dealing
    with brokers. As a matter of fact, brokers would appear to be in a far better position
    to meet large customers' considerable requirements for risk management services and
    advice. The parties dispute that the broking market has to be segmented further on
    the basis of client size. They argue that, from a demand-side perspective, the
    progression of customer needs across the spectrum is gradual and not clearly
    delineated. From a supply-side perspective, the skills needed to meet the developing
    needs of a client do not change fundamentally as a function of client size. This
    distinguishes in the parties’ opinion the broking sector from the auditing sector
    where a separate market for the provision of auditing services to multinational
    corporations can be considered4. In the end, although there is some evidence that
    large corporations could constitute a separate market , the question can be left open
    since serious doubts as to the compatibility with the common market can be excluded
    under any aspect.
18. Finally, the parties argue that it would not be appropriate to sub-divide the broking
    market further on the basis of business sectors or the type of risk insured. Whilst
    there have been indications that as regards certain industries (i.e. marine, aviation and
    space, energy) as well as certain risk types (i.e. directors’& officers’ liability) distinct
    markets may be identified by reasons of limited substitutability on both demand and
    supply-side, this question can be left open because not specific concerns arise in the
    present case.
4  Decision of 20 May 1998 in Case M.1016 – Price Waterhouse/Coopers&Lybrand
                                                4

19. In conclusion, the product markets considered for the purpose of the present
     competitive analysis are the insurance broking market and, within this market, the
     sectors of consumer broking (placement of insurance cover for personal risks),
     broking for commercial clients (placement of insurance cover for commercial risks
     and related services) and in particular broking for large corporate clients. The final
     product market definition can be left open because, even on the basis of the
     narrowest segmentation, effective competition would not be significantly impeded in
     the EEA or any substantial part of that area.
Relevant geographic market
20. There is a wide variation in the methods of insurance distribution from Member State
     to Member State. In Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy,
     Portugal and Sweden between 75% and 95% of insurance services are distributed
     directly by insurance companies or their tied agents, with independent intermediaries
     having a smaller share of the market of below 20%. It cannot be excluded, however,
     that intermediaries such as brokers will increase their market share in those countries
     where the distribution of insurance is being deregulated. In other countries, in
     particular Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the United Kingdom, direct client
     contact has historically been largely the preserve of the broker as intermediary, with
     brokers placing between 45% and 90% of insurances. Brokers’ activities are subject
     to different regulatory frameworks in the different Member States.
21. Customers normally procure broking services in those countries in which they are
     active. Large and especially multi-national clients tend to use one broker to place
     insurance for some types of risk, notably if this risk affects a number of countries in
     which the company is active, whereas different brokers may be used to cover risks of
     a more limited geographical scope. For the purpose of the present analysis, the
     question whether the relevant geographic is larger than national can be left open
     since, in all alternative geographic market definitions considered, serious doubts
     about the compatibility with the common market can be excluded.
Reinsurance distribution
Relevant Product Market
22.     The distribution of reinsurance involves the placement of reinsurance on behalf of
        insurers and reinsurers. The parties submit that the relevant product market
        includes services provided by both intermediaries and reinsurers who reinsure risks
        directly. They argue that, from the point of view of insurer and reinsurer clients,
        reinsurance companies and brokers are substantial and direct competitors because
        the top reinsurance companies all act as direct insurers for a substantial part of
        their business. It is not necessary to decide whether a distinct product market for
        reinsurance broking exists because, in all alternative market definitions considered,
        effective competition would not be significantly impeded in the EEA or any
        substantial part of that area.
Relevant Geographic Market
                                              5

23.     The Commission has recognised in previous decisions that risks for insurer and
        reinsurer clients are placed on a world-wide basis5. Likewise, related broking
        services are provided on a world-wide basis. For the present analysis, the relevant
        geographic market can therefore be considered to be world-wide in scope.
Human resources consulting
Relevant product market
24.     The parties submit that their human resources consulting activities mainly overlap
        with respect to Retirement and Employee Benefits consulting. In this area the
        parties advise on and administer in particular pension and other benefits schemes
        for corporate customers 6. The parties provide such consulting services almost
        exclusively to corporate clients and to individuals only within the framework of a
        corporate client mandate.
25.     The market investigation has confirmed that Retirement and Employee Benefits
        consulting should be considered as a distinct product market. Consulting in this
        area requires specific sets of skills, qualifications and technical resources. In
        particular, Retirement and Employee Benefits consulting often involves actuarial
        input, for instance in designing and implementing retirement benefit packages,
        whereas no significant actuarial competence is required other areas of human
        resources consulting. Likewise, corporate customers distinguish between the
        specific services required in both areas and, where necessary, procure these
        services separately.
26.     In the area of non-retirement/non-benefits human resources consulting, the parties’
        activities overlap only to a limited extent, as [… ] does not have substantial
        consultancy activity in this sector.
Relevant geographic market
27.     The different fiscal and regulatory environments with respect to pensions,
        healthcare and other benefits across the Member States could be seen as an
        indication that the geographic markets for the above services are largely national.
        For the particular reliance on occupational benefits provided by the employer
        rather than through social security systems, the UK and Ireland have the most well
        developed corporate funded pension arrangements. On the other hand, it can be
        observed that part of the consulting services in question is procured by multi-
        national corporations from large, internationally active consultants. However, it is
        not necessary to further delineate the relevant geographic markets because affected
        markets exist only in the United Kingdom and Ireland and effective competition would
        not be significantly impeded in these markets (see below).
IV.   COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
Insurance distribution
5   Decisions of 20 December 1996 in Case M.862 – AXA/UAP and 16 February 1998 in Case M.1043 –
    BAT/Zürich
6   Healthcare schemes can be considered an insignificant service component in most countries.
                                                  6

28.     The following assessment refers to the non-life insurance market only, the life-
        insurance activity of the parties being considerably less important.
29.     As noted above, there are indications that the substitutability of broking operations
        by other insurance distribution channels generally tends to increase the smaller the
        size of clients becomes. Although there may be some notable exceptions such as
        small commercial clients presenting complex risk coverage requirements, it
        appears that direct underwriters, tied agents, banks and to a certain extent direct
        sellers compete actively with brokers on the lower end of the customer-range
        (personal lines and small commercial business), whereas brokers are by far the
        preferred provider of insurance and risk management services as far as the upper
        end of the customer-range is concerned, that is large corporations and
        multinationals. Thus, the major impact of the concentration is to be felt on the
        market of commercial broking (i.e. excluding personal lines) and more in particular
        in the segment of large corporations and multinationals. The following market
        share analysis starts from a larger market configuration and then focuses on the
        large corporation segment where the impact of the concentration will be most
        significant. Precise market share information is difficult to obtain, in particular in
        respect to the broking sector taken alone. Several competitors have been unable to
        provide their own estimates, so that sometimes crosschecking the figures provided
        by the parties has been problematic. However, the market investigation has
        provided indications that have enabled the Commission to make a substantiated
        assessment in spite of some missing or just roughly estimated figures.
Market shares and other market data
30.     Marsh & McLennan and Sedgwick are reported to be the first and the third largest
        brokers worldwide respectively in terms of brokerage revenue. Other brokers of
        major size include Aon Corporation (US) and Willis Corroon Group plc (UK).
        These appear to be the only four groups with global presence. Other sizeable
        competitors include Arthur J. Gallagher, Jardine Lloyd Thomson, Accordia,
        Lambert Fenchurch and Forbes Group.
31.     As regards the market analysis of non-life insurance placement (both including and
        excluding direct underwriters), the parties have provided estimates of market sizes
        and market shares based on gross premiums (thus referring to the value of
        insurance placed).
32.     Taking into account the total non-life insurance placement (brokers plus other
        forms of insurance distribution), the parties' combined share, according to the
        notification, does not exceed [5-15%] 7 in any EEA country and amount to [<5%] 7
        at EEA level.
33.     If insurance placements via brokers alone are taken into account, the data available
        become less accurate. They must be constructed based on estimates of the shares
        of insurance placements that are sold via brokers, which as noted above vary
        significantly amongst different Member States. According to the parties, their
        combined market shares in this case will amount to [10-15%]7 at EEA level, the
        major competitors being Aon and Willis Corroon with shares of between 5% and
7   Business secrets.

        15% as well as Jardine Lloyd Thomson and Lambert Fenchurch with shares below
        5%. Aon and Willis Corroon have a quite extensive presence in most EEA
        countries. In addition, in Member and EFTA states there are a number of smaller
        brokers mainly operating at domestic level.

35.     It follows from the above that certain countries present strong penetration rates of
        brokers as opposed to direct underwriters and other forms of insurance
        distribution. The merger will impact more strongly on these countries, namely
        Belgium and the UK. The parties’ combined share will also exceed [<25%]7 in a
        number of other countries (France, Italy, Portugal), in which, however, the
        penetration rate of brokers is generally lower than 20%. It must be noted that
        Sweden and Finland, the only two countries where the parties would exceed
        [<40%] 7, feature a very low rate of penetration of the broker channel (less than
        5%) as opposed to the other channels of distribution of insurance products. In the
        Netherlands and Ireland the parties market shares are below [<20%]8.
36.     The market investigation carried out by the Commission has shown that the above
        market share data are not substantially challenged by competitors. Some
        discrepancies as regards specific national markets do not put into question the final
        assessment of the merger.
37.     If, as it would appear more appropriate in the light of the product market
        definition above, the analysis is limited to commercial broking (i.e. insurance
        placed via brokers excluding personal lines), the parties would have a share at
        EEA level amounting to [20-25%] 8. Their combined shares will exceed [<20%]8 in
8   Business secrets.
                                                 8

       a number of countries, namely France ([<20%]8), Portugal ([<25%] 8), Ireland
       ([<25%] 8), Italy ([<35%] 8), The Netherlands ([<30%] 8), UK ([<30%] 8), Sweden
       (<35%] 8), Belgium ([<35%] 8) and Finland ([<40%]8). These figures provided by
       the parties have not been challenged during the market investigation. No data are
       available concerning competitors.
38.    As regards the segment of commercial broking to large corporations, the
       Commission considers that the assessment of the merged entity's position on the
       market is better expressed in terms of brokers’total revenues rather than insurance
       premiums. As explained above, commercial broking to large corporations include
       a large degree of ancillary services. These services are increasingly remunerated on
       a fee basis, which is in addition to, and independent from the fees or commissions
       received on the insurance cover placed. In addition, the parties have submitted that
       they receive also additional payments from insurers, which are calculated by
       reference to the overall book of business placed by the broker with the
       underwriter. Hence, the total revenue of the broker provides a more precise
       parameter to evaluate market strength in this segment.
39.    However, precise revenue based market sizes and market shares are not available,
       missing any public information in this respect. The parties have provided a break
       down of their revenues between commission and fees for all Member and EFTA
       States impacted by the merger, in respect of corporations whose turnover exceeds
       US$ 100M and US$ 850M respectively. These figures demonstrate that in most
       countries the importance of the fee component (relating to ancillary services) of
       the broker revenue is not significant [… ]8, which means that the premium’s based
       market shares can still be taken as a good indicator of the market position of the
       parties. The exceptions are Belgium, Ireland, The Netherlands, UK and Sweden,
       i.c., apart from the latter, those countries were the penetration rate of brokers in
       the total insurance distribution is highest. For all these countries the parties have
       provided estimates of their own and of the other brokers' share of insurance
       services supplied to the national top 20 corporates by revenue (which are in the
       large majority of cases also within the Euro 500 list if the top 500 companies by
       revenue in the EU). The picture resulting demonstrates that whilst Marsh &
       McLennan and Sedgwick together are constantly amongst the main provider of
       broking services in all countries examined and indeed in many cases can be said to
       be market leader, the large majority of customers appoint two or more brokers to
       meet their needs, often in addition to direct underwriters themselves. The picture
       also confirms the diversity of patterns from country to country. Swedish
       corporations still have limited recourse to broker's services as opposed to other
       forms of procuring insurance cover. In UK, The Netherlands and Belgium there is
       a wide variation in the ways in which large corporates choose to satisfy their
       insurance needs and, accordingly, the proportion of cover provided by brokers
       varies considerably from company to company. In Ireland, probably due to the
       smaller size of top corporates, there are various brokers operating at domestic
       level, which can provide a viable alternative to the merged entity.
Assessment
40.    In general, it appears that the market tr end for commercial insurance business
       indicates that there has been a general decrease of insurance premiums and costs.
       This seems to be due to the recent lack of major casualties (which is a cyclical
       phenomenon) and to the over-capacity in the supply offered to large corporate
                                              9

       clients, the latter resulting both from the insurers capital base’s increase as well as
       from the growing risk retention by clients through captive insurance or self
       insurance. Price competition among insurers to maintain the premium volume and
       the pressure exerted by brokers to get the best deal for their clients have assisted
       this trend. Moreover, the development of alternative risk management programs
       offered by financial institutions has provided further pressure on brokers and
       insurers.
41.    Some insurance companies have expressed the view that this merger will result in
       increased buying powers of the parties. However, in general they consider that
       market transparency and competition between brokers will ultimately reduce the
       importance of this aspect. Especially large insurers have submitted that they will
       have sufficient counter leverage and that they do not see any significant impact on
       their commercial policy arising from the merger.
a) Large corporates
42.    The large majority of the third parties interviewed by the Commission, whilst
       confirming that the major impact of the operation is to be felt on the segment of
       commercial broking for large corporations, have supported the conclusion that any
       serious concerns for competition either in this segment or more in general on the
       broking market can be excluded. In addition to broadly confirming that the figures
       provided by the parties are not substantially wrong, they have submitted a number
       of other arguments, which at the same time complement and enable a correct
       evaluation of the above market data.
43.    Firstly, other intermediaries such as merchant banks, accounting firms and other
       consultants and financial institution providing risk management consultancy and
       services (so called alternative risk management programs) are said to be already an
       important source of at least potential competition to brokers. Large customers
       have indicated that they expect those operators to become increasingly viable
       competitors for traditional insurance brokers and some customers declared that
       they would be ready to switch totally or partially to this alternative providers,
       should insurance brokers attempt to raise prices at supracompetitive levels.
44.    Secondly, the market investigation has confirmed that large customers have the
       option to (partially) internalise the services provided by brokers, by creating risk
       management functions and/or internal insurance operations. Indeed, this practice
       is extensively in use in certain countries (i.e. this is a traditional feature in German
       corporations).
45.    Thirdly, large corporations do normally have an important degree of
       countervailing power that serves to constrain any market power of insurance
       brokers.
46.    Fourthly, as the segment includes as client types large corporations and
       multinationals, it is evident that the geographical scope of the market tends to
       exceed national countries to become increasingly EEA wide, if not worldwide
       especially as regards certain risk types (i.e. aviation and space, financial
       institutions).
47.    The combination of these factors allows excluding the possibility that serious
       concerns for competition arise from the merger in respect of the market for
                                              10

        commercial broking to large corporations. Also, these factors are normally to be
        found across the whole range of risk types or client industries. Indeed, the market
        investigation has provided no indications that the merged entity may price
        discriminate or otherwise abuse in respect of any particular risk type or category
        of clients.
b) Medium-sized and small commercial customers
48.     It is evident that the weight of these factors decreases if medium-sized and small
        business customers are taken into account, especially if they do not require
        coverage for complex risks. The market investigation has confirmed that for this
        segment other factors such as easy new entries due to the absence of substantial
        barriers and a much higher supply-side substitutability by other insurance
        distributors prevent the merger to cause any serious concerns for customers and
        competitors.
c) Consumer broking
49.     Finally, as already noted, no major impact is expected on the consumer broking
        segment of the market, where substitutability by other forms of insurance
        distribution is highest and hence the parties' market shares considerably less
        significant. In this business, where brokers play a less important role and the risk
        covers are more standardised and market transparency higher, there has been an
        increasing disintermediation process following the general trend already registered
        in the financial business area. The IT’s role in this area appears to be significant
        and have contributed to a further reduction of the costs to the consumers.
50.     In view of the above it can be concluded that, whatever market definition adopted,
        the merger between Marsh & McLennan and Sedgwick will not lead to the
        creation or strengthening of a dominant position in respect to their insurance
        broking operations.
Reinsurance
51.     The market for reinsurance distribution appears to be highly competitive due to a
        number of factors, such as the strength of the capital markets, the entrance of new
        capacity and the recent lack of major casualties. In this regard the merger of
        brokers active in this market is perceived by the market as to exert additional
        pressure on reinsurers regarding prices and coverage.
52.     Estimates provided by the parties attribute to brokers some 25% of the total
        reinsurance placement market, while reinsurance companies direct handle the
        remaining 75%. This estimate has been roughly confirmed as applying as well to
        the European market. According to the notification the merger between Marsh &
        McLennan and Sedgwick will afford them a worldwide position comparable to
        that of the other major broker Aon (between [5% and 10%] 9 of the premiums
        going into the worldwide market, between [20% and 35%] 9 if direct reinsurers are
        excluded). A number of other brokers compete in this sector including Willis
9   Business secrets.
                                              11

         Faber, EW Blanche, Benfiels Greig, Jardine Lloyd Thompson and Le Blanc de
         Nicholay. In addition, whether they are taken as direct or only potential
         competitors, direct reinsurers such as Munich Re, Swiss Re, Employers Re and
         General Re, which between them hold [<35%]9 of the worldwide premiums, can
         be taken to exert sufficient competitive pressure on the parties.
53.      The market investigation has confirmed this conclusion: the parties combined
         market shares for the European market is said not to exceed [<20%] 9 of
         reinsurance placement by brokers, a number other players will remain in the
         market place and customers such as large insurance companies will have
         significant countervailing power. The third parties contacted have not expressed
         any substantial concern about the effect of the concentration, supporting the
         conclusion that actual and potential competition in the relevant market will remain
         sufficiently viable, so as to exclude that the operation will significantly affect
         competition in the market concerned.
Human resources consulting
54.      Each of the parties provide Retirement and Employee Benefits consulting services.
         Both parties have substantial market shares only in Ireland and the United
         Kingdom. The parties are active through their subsidiaries William Mercer
         Companies and Sedgwick Noble Lowndes (UK)/Irish Pension Trust (Ireland)
         respectively.
Ireland
55.      A substantial number of firms, both international and local, are already established
         in the Irish Retirement and Employee Benefits consulting market. The market is
         of a relatively small size in a European context (e.g. covering a workforce of
         approximately 1.4 million). Customer companies are generally small or medium-
         sized, with relatively few large corporations10.

        smaller companies may not easily be in a position to make this choice.
62.     On the other hand, small and medium-sized clients have a choice amongst a
        number of Retirement and Employee Benefits consultants in Ireland, given that up
        to ten medium-sized providers remain active. In fact, smaller companies may be
        more inclined to choose a local service provider, and some clients may prefer a
        more personal and individual service. This choice is not removed by the present
        concentration. More specifically, a sufficient number of Retirement and Employee
        Benefits consulting providers present in the market retain a comprehensive
        consulting capacity (in terms of staffing and administrative back-up) with respect
        to advice on as well as administration of retirement and benefits schemes.
63.     With respect to the more limited number of large corporate customers for
        Retirement and Employee Benefits consulting services in the Irish market, the
        investigation has produced some evidence that these have a certain preference for
        large benefit consultants. In particular, multi-national companies may tend to
        procure the services of consultants operating on an international basis. However,
        apart from having the option to internalise at least partly the services provided by
        Retirement and Employee Benefits consultants, the investigation results set out
        below confirm that large corporate customers will continue to have a choice
        amongst suitable competitors, and that internationally operating suppliers will be
        able to expand their market position or enter the market.
64.     Existing and potential competition by insurance companies as well as non-
        specialised consulting firms needs to be taken into account. Insurance companies
        have already established a certain presence in the Irish Retirement and Employee
        Benefits market with respect to the distribution of Defined Contribution pension

    schemes which does not require specific actuarial input. Defined Contribution
    schemes accounted for approximately 20% of members in pension schemes in
    1997, with a faster growth rate than Defined Benefit schemes, and therefore would
    seem to present a recognised alternative to other types of pension scheme. The
    most common type of pension scheme, the Defined Benefit scheme, does require
    actuarial calculations and certification by actuaries in Ireland. However, the
    actuarial input required for such schemes may be procured by consulting firms
    without an in-house actuarial capacity, from third party actuaries or from a number
    of insurance companies providing actuarial services for Defined Benefits schemes
    such as Irish Life, New Ireland, Standard Life and Friends First.
65. The main barriers to entry and expansion in the Retirement and Employee Benefits
    consulting market can be described as: the need for qualified and experienced staff;
    the time or capital needed to acquire a client basis; the necessary reputation; and
    the need for a certain administrative back-up capacity (notably for outsourced
    pension scheme administration). Relevant capital costs relate to recruitment and
    staff costs as well as systems and marketing expenditure.
66. Some of the parties’ main competitors in the Irish Retirement and Employee
    Benefits consulting market belong to international professional services groups (in
    particular Aon Beech Hill, Watson Wyatt, Buck Consultants, KPMG and
    Bacon&Woodrow). Although these competitors hold significantly smaller market
    shares than the parties, there is no evidence to suggest that they will not be able to
    expand their presence in the market concerned. Each of these competitors has
    substantial international activities and most are well established in the United
    Kingdom. As multi-national firms, all competitors quoted above have the
    reputation, the staff, the capital and the administrative capacity necessary to
    reinforce their presence in Ireland. It can assumed that these competitors have to
    a similar degree access to large corporate (multi-national) clients as the parties.
67. With respect to the recruitment of qualified staff in particular, employment
    contracts in the market concerned do not generally impose severe restrictions on
    staff mobility. The investigation has also confirmed that there is mutual
    recognition of qualifications by the relevant professional actuarial bodies.
    Language does not constitute an entry barrier. Therefore, competitors do not
    normally face serious legal or practical obstacles to attracting qualified staff or
    using UK-based actuarial staff where necessary. There is some evidence to confirm
    that large accountancy and consultancy firms, such as Pricewaterhouse Coopers,
    are recruiting actuaries in order to reinforce their pensions and actuarial
    consultancy in Ireland.
68. Although specialised, the relevant market seems to be sufficiently open, providing
    that those willing to enter have the relevant expertise of its resources, a credible
    organisation and an adequate customer base. In this regard the international
    consultancy firms which have recently shown interest in entering the market seem
    to be in the best position.
69. In summary, the evidence gathered does not raise serious doubts that the proposed
    concentration will significantly impede effective competition in the market
    concerned, in particular, that the parties, after combining their operations, will be
    able to act to a large extent independently of competitors and customers. On the
    basis of the information available, it can be assumed that existing and potential
                                           15

        competition in the relevant market will be sufficiently viable to counter any
        possible attempt by the parties to exploit their position, and that new market
        entries and the expansion of competitors’existing market position remain possible.

71.     The market investigation has confirmed that the parties’ combined market share
        will not probably exceed [… ]18 and that a number of substantial competitors will
        remain in the market place. The results of the investigation do also suggest that
        the conditions for entry and expansion in the Retirement and Employee Benefits
        consulting market are similar to those described above. This supports the
        conclusion that existing and potential competition in the relevant market will
        remain sufficiently viable. The competitors and trade associations contacted have
        not expressed any substantial concerns about the effect of the concentration.
72.     On the demand side, the UK Retirement and Employee Benefits consulting market
        comprises a significant number of corporate customers with substantial buying
        power. Corporate customers have expressed a cost-conscious approach and
        would seem to be ready to consider alternative suppliers in the procurement of
        consulting services on a case-by-case basis. Some customers stressed that their
        choice is not guided by the provider’s size but by skills and experience. They
        considered that viable competitors to Marsh&McLennan and Segdwick are
        available.
