 Dear Sir,
 Subject: Case n° IV/M069 - KYOWA/SAITAMA BANKS
                   Notification of 6 February 1991 pursuant to Article 4 of
                   Council Regulation n° 4064/89
 1. The notification referred to above concerns the proposed merger
      between The Kyowa Bank Limited (Kyowa) and The Saitama Bank
      Limited (Saitama). The notified operation is a merger in
      accordance with the statutory provisions contained in the
      Commercial Code of Japan.
 2. After examination of the notification, the Commission has
      concluded that the notified operation falls within the scope of
      Council Regulation n° 4064/89 and does not raise serious doubts
      as to its compatibility with the common market.
 CONCENTRATION
 3. The notified operation is a concentration within the meaning of
      Article 3(1)a of the Regulation. The parties have entered into
      an agreement which provides for the following process: Kyowa
      will absorb Saitama assuming all the assets, rights, obligations
      and liabilities of Saitama which will be dissolved. The
      shareholders of Saitama will be issued with shares in Kyowa on
                                             Rue de la Loi 200 - B-1049 Brussels - Belgium

                                - 2 -
    a one-for-one basis. The name of the bank will be changed to, in
    English, "The Kyowa Saitama Bank, Limited". It is the parties'
    present intention that the merger will take effect on the 1
    April 1991.
COMMUNITY DIMENSION
4. The operation has a Community dimension. One tenth of the total
    assets of both parties amounts to ECU 20,876 million and the
    amount of these assets attributable to the Community under the
    method of calculation set out in Article 5(3) of the Regulation
    is as follows: Kyowa - ECU [deleted]; Saitama - ECU [deleted].
    The amount of these assets attributable to any particular Member
    State does not exceed two thirds in respect of either bank.
COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
5. Kyowa and Saitama both enjoy a strong position in Japan, where
    they are ranked seventeenth and twentieth respectively by equity
    in the survey published by "The Banker" (January 1991). Both
    banks concentrate on retail customer and small business lending
    in metropolitan Tokyo, and consequently the great majority of
    their business is done outside the Community. A worldwide
    ranking by shareholders' equity of the top 500 banks in a
    Euromoney Survey in June 1990 placed Kyowa and Saitama in
    seventy-third and seventy-seventh position respectively. Both
    banks see the main aim of their international business being to
    support and assist their domestic customer base. Within the
    Community, Kyowa has two wholly-owned subsidiaries based in the
    United Kingdom and the Netherlands respectively, a branch office
    in London and representative offices in Amsterdam and Frankfurt.
    Saitama has a wholly-owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom and
    another in Belgium and a representative office in Frankfurt.
    Both banks carry out over half of their Community business in
    the United Kingdom. The banks do not have a retail banking
    network within the Community and almost all their Community
    activity can be regarded as wholesale banking i.e. lending to
    and borrowing from     other banks, loans to large, generally
    corporate, customers and other financial services.
6. The volume of business carried out by the banks within the
    Community is small in comparison to the total amount of such
    business in the Community and consequently the concentration is
    unlikely to have any effect on competition. The parties have
    supplied the Commission with information on their main fields of
    activity in the Community wholesale banking sector. The
    following categories of business provide an indication of the
    banks' position within the Community:
    -     syndicated facilities signed in the Community (including
          syndicated credits, Euronote facilities, commercial paper
          issues, private placements, international bond issues and
          warrant issues). These constitute a large part of the
          business of the banks in the Community. Kyowa accounted
          for [deleted]% of the total syndicated facilities signed
          in the financial year April 1989 to March 1990 which
          amounted to US $ 188.655 million.(1) Saitama accounted for
          [deleted]% of the total, giving a combined share of
          [deleted]%.

                                - 3 -
    -     Eurobond underwriting: out of 1526 issues with a value of
          US $ 209,085 million during the year 1989(2), Kyowa
          participated in [deleted]% of the issues but had a share
          of only [deleted]% by value. Saitama participated in
          [deleted]% of the issues and had a share of [deleted]% by
          value.
    -     Interbank loans as in balance sheet: this item in the
          balance sheet of banks in the United Kingdom as at 31
          March 1990 amounted to £ 609,671 million(3) of which Kyowa
          accounted for only [deleted]%. The corresponding figure
          for Saitama is [deleted]%. In the Netherlands and Belgium
          the parties' respective shares were again less than
          [deleted]%.
    -     Loans to customers as in balance sheet: this           item
          totalled £ 510,413 million(4) as at 31 March 1990 for banks
          in the United Kingdom and Kyowa's share amounted to
          [deleted]%. The corresponding figure for Saitama was
          [deleted]%. The shares in the Netherlands and Belgium were
          both less than [deleted]%.
7. A further indication of the parties' relative position is
    provided by their share of total assets as recorded in the
    balance sheets of banks in a particular Member State. In the
    United Kingdom where both banks carry out over half of their
    Community business, Kyowa accounted for only [deleted]% of
    balance sheet assets and Saitama accounted for [deleted]% (as at
    31 March 1990) making a combined share of less than [deleted]%.
    The corresponding figures for the Netherlands and Belgium are
    even lower. In view of this position it is not necessary for the
    purposes of this case, to adopt a precise definition of the
    relevant service market since the figures, including those above
    relating to narrowly defined fields of activity, make it clear
    that the merged bank will not hold a dominant position in any of
    the Member States in which it will operate or in the Community
    as a whole. For that reason the question of geographic market
    definition can also be left open.
    Given the merged banks' extremely low shares in the Community's
    financial markets, the concentration will not create or
    strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
    competition would be significantly impeded in the common market
    or in a substantial part of it.
8. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose
    the notified operation and to declare it compatible with the
    common market. This decision is adopted in application of
    Article 6, paragraph 1(b) of Council Regulation n° 4064/89.
