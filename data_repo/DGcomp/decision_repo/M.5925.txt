To the notifying party:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:        Case No COMP/M.5925 - METLIFE/ ALICO/ DELAM
                Notification of 19 July 2010 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                No 139/20041
1. On 19/07/2010, the European Commission received a notification of a proposed
      concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 by which the
      undertaking MetLife Inc. ("MetLife", USA) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b)
      of the Merger Regulation control of the whole of the undertakings American Life Insurance
      Company ("Alico", USA) and Delaware American Life Insurance Company ("DelAm",
      USA) by way of purchase of shares.
I.     THE PARTIES
2. MetLife is a US-based company active worldwide in the life insurance, non-life
      insurance and reinsurance sectors and also provides financial products and services to
      individual and institutional customers.
3. Both Alico and DelAm (jointly the "Target Companies") are US-based subsidiaries of
      American International Group, Inc ("AIG", USA). Alico is a provider of life, accident &
1         OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1, hence "Merger Regulation". With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty
          on the Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the
          replacement of "Community" by "Union" and "common market" by "internal market". The
          terminology of the TFEU will be used throughout this decision.

    health insurance, retirement planning, and wealth management solutions on a worldwide
    basis to individual customers, corporate clients and high net worth individuals and is
    also active in the global reinsurance market. DelAm provides wealth management,
    retirement planning, life and health insurance services for commercial, institutional and
    individual customers, only in the US.
II.   CONCENTRATION
4. On March 7, 2010, MetLife entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with AIG in order
    to acquire the entire issued share capital of the Target Companies. MetLife will finance
    the operation partially in cash and partially through the issue, by MetLife to AIG, of
    MetLife Common Equivalent Securities, which will have economic rights equivalent to
    MetLife's common stock. The common stock and common stock equivalents to be issued
    is expected to be less than 23.5% of MetLife’s outstanding common stock and according
    to the notifying party the acquisition by AIG of Metlife shares will not enable AIG to
    exercise any type of control over MetLife within the meaning of the EU Merger
    Regulation.
5. Metlife will thus acquire sole control over the Target Companies and constitute a
    concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
III. EU DIMENSION
6. The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more than
    EUR 5 billion2 [MetLife: EUR 53,830 million; Alico: EUR 8,145 million; DelAm: EUR 24
    million]. Each of MetLife and Alico has a EU-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million
    [MetLife: EUR […] million; Alico: EUR […] million], but they do not achieve more than
    two-thirds of their aggregate EU-wide turnover within one and the same Member State.
7. The notified operation therefore has an EU dimension under Article 1 of the Merger
    Regulation.
IV. COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
Relevant product and geographic markets
8. Both MetLife and Alico are active in the provision of life insurance, non-life insurance
    and reinsurance in the EU. DelAm is not active in the EU.
9. Concerning the product market definition, the Commission has in the past
    distinguished between three broad categories of insurance, namely: (i) life insurance,
    (ii) non-life insurance and (iii) reinsurance3.
10. The Commission has also noted that, from the demand side, both life and non-life
    insurance may at least in theory be divided into as many individual product markets
    as there are different kinds of risks covered, given that their characteristics, premiums
2   Turnover calculated in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Merger Regulation and the Commission
    Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice (OJ C95, 16.04.2008, p1).

    and purposes are distinct and that there is no substitutability from the consumers'
    perspective between different risks insured. However, the Commission has
    recognised that supply side considerations may lead to broader product markets in
    respect of certain types of risk.4 This indicates that different types of insurance may
    be included in the same product market.
11. With respect to life insurance, the Commission has traditionally made a primary
    distinction between group life insurance products and individual life insurance5.
    However, the Commission has also made a general distinction between
    predominantly risk-based products, on the one hand, and products oriented towards
    savings and pension provision, on the other6. In previous decisions, however, the
    Commission has left open the exact product market definitions.
12. As regards non-life insurance, the Commission has previously considered various
    possible segments, inter alia, motor, fire, transport, health, property, general civil
    liability, casualty, litigation, working accidents and credit insurance7. In previous
    decisions, however, the Commission has left open the exact product market
    definitions.
13. The Commission has so far left open whether reinsurance constitutes a single relevant
    product market or whether it should be further subdivided into life and non-life
    segments8.
14. The notifying party accepts all the above sub-segmentations of the Commission and
    has provided data on this basis.
    Geographic Markets
15. With respect to the geographical scope, while recognising that insurance markets are
    becoming more open to intra-Community competition9, the Commission, in its
    previous decisions, has defined the markets for both life and non-life insurance as
    being national in scope as a result of national distribution channels, the established
    market structures, fiscal constraints and differing regulatory systems10. The
    Commission has previously found that the scope of the geographic market for
    reinsurance is global due to the need to pool risks on a worldwide basis11. As there is
    no indication that the geographic market is different in the present case, a global
    market for reinsurance is considered.

16. The notifying party accepts all the above sub-segmentations of the Commission and
     has provided data on this basis.
17. In any event it is not necessary to conclusively define any relevant product and
     geographic market since the transaction will not lead to serious doubts as to its
     compatibility with the internal market irrespective of the exact product and
     geographic market definition.
Competitive assessment
18. According to MetLife, the activities of the undertaking concerned overlap in: life
     insurance in Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Spain and the UK; non-life insurance in
     Greece and the UK and finally reinsurance, which is a global market.
19. Concerning the overall life insurance market, the following table, compiled by MetLife,
     shows the combined market shares of Alico and MetLife on the basis of life insurance
     premiums generated in the Member States concerned in 2009. The transaction does not
     lead to any horizontally affected markets:

20. Turning now to further possible product market sub-segmentations for the life insurance
     market, under all possible market definitions in Hungary, Ireland, Poland, Spain and the
     UK, the combined market shares of Alico and MetLife are always below [5-10%], with
     the exception of the individual life risk protection market segment in Poland, where they
     are at [5-10%].
21. In Greece, MetLife has identified two possible market segmentations where the
     combined market shares of Alico and MetLife together could be [10-20%], namely those
     of (i) individual savings and pension life insurance products with [10-20%] and in the
     narrowest segment of (ii) individual savings life insurance products with [10-20%]. It
     should be noted in this context that MetLife is active in the life insurance market in
     Greece only though its individual life savings product called "Auvida".
22. MetLife stresses that the above market shares for Greece are the highest they could be,
     but is unable to provide more precise data. The reason for this is that the reporting of the
     insurance market size data by the Hellenic Republic Ministry of Economics and
     Finance, Private Insurance Supervisory Committee ("PISC"), the Greek insurance sector
     regulator, does not reflect the total insurance premiums written in Greece. The
                                                      4

    PISC only publishes those premiums generated by Greek-licensed entities. Accordingly,
    those premiums generated by insurers providing insurance in Greece on a freedom of
    services (FOS) basis under Directive 2002/83/EC12 are not captured in the data
    published by the PISC.
23. MetLife is active in the life insurance sector in Greece13 through MetLife Europe
    Limited ("MetLife Europe"), a wholly-owned subsidiary registered in Ireland14, on a
    FOS basis and is not, therefore, licensed by the PISC and its data are consequently not
    collected, reported and published.
24. MetLife, states that it is has not been able to identify any other insurance companies
    operating in Greece on a FOS basis. It has therefore reconstructed itself the two markets
    where it considers itself to be active (see above) as if it were the only company to
    operate in Greece on a FOS basis, by adding to the data provided by the PISC the
    premiums generated in Greece by MetLife. It has then calculated that the highest
    combined market shares of Alico and MetLife would be [10-20%] in the segment of
    individual savings and pension life insurance products, and [10-20%] in the individual
    savings life insurance products in Greece.
25. Account has also to be taken of the fact that for each of these two possible market
    segmentations, there will be, post-merger, two competitors with market shares higher or
    similar to those of Alico and MetLife (EFG Eurolife and InterAmerican for the
    individual savings and pension life insurance products and Ethniki and InterAmerican
    for the individual savings and pension life insurance products).
26. Turning now to the non-life insurance market, the following table, compiled by MetLife,
    shows the combined market shares of Alico and MetLife on the basis of non-life
    insurance premiums generated in the Member States concerned in 2009. MetLife states
    that on a narrower hypothetical market segmentation, the activities of the Parties would
    not overlap in non-life insurance activities in Greece and the UK. The transaction does
    not therefore lead to any horizontally affected markets:

Source: notification
27. Finally, for the reinsurance market, in 2009, MetLife generated reinsurance premiums of
    EUR 810 million, ALICO of EUR 132.7 million and DelAm of EUR 7.1 million (in
    respect of life coverage in the US), each of the three having a market share (on a global
    basis) of less than [0-5%].

    assurance, [2002] OJ L 345/1, 19/12/2002 (the "FOS Directive").
13  In Greece, MetLife sells only one life insurance product, an individual savings product called "Auvida".
    "Auvida" is a form of retirement plan and belongs to the group of products known as variable annuities.
14  MetLife Europe is licensed by the Irish regulator, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.

28. Thus, the transaction will not give rise to any competition concerns in any relevant
    market.
V.   CONCLUSION
29. For the above reasons, the European Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the internal market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger
    Regulation.
