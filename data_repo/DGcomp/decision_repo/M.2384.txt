                                                                     To the notifying parties:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:        Case No COMP/M.2384 – Ratos/3i Group/Atle
                Notification of 1 March 2001 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                No 4064/891
1.     On 1 March 2001, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
       by which the undertaking Woodrose Invest AB (Woodrose) controlled by the
       undertaking Ratos AB (Ratos) and venture capitalist 3i Group plc (3i) acquires within
       the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation control of the whole of the
       undertaking Atle AB (Atle) by way of public bid announced on 19 February 2001.
2.     After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
       operation falls within the scope of the Council Regulation and does not raise serious
       doubts as to its compatibility with the common market or with the functioning of the
       EEA Agreement.
I.     THE PARTIES
3.     Ratos is a Swedish holding company, listed on the O-list at the OM Stockholm
       Exchange. 3i is a UK venture capital company that primarily invests in Europe. It is
       listed on the London Stock Exchange. Woodrose is a company incorporated in Sweden
       that serves as the vehicle to make a public offer for Atle. Atle is a Swedish private
       equity company, listed on the A-list at the OM Stockholm Exchange.

II.  THE OPERATION
4.   The concentration consists of the acquisition by Woodrose of Atle. Following
     Woodrose’s completion of the acquisition, Atle's investment portfolio will be divided
     between Ratos and 3i in approximate ratio 38:62 by value. 84 % of the investments in
     which Atle exercise a decisive influence will be owned jointly by Ratos and 3i. In
     addition one wholly owned investment and one minority position in a listed company
     will be transferred to Ratos, whereas a large number of investments (substantially all
     minority positions) will be transferred to 3i. Ratos and 3i will jointly own all of the
     Atle assets (including those that eventually will be transferred to Ratos and 3i) for a
     period of up to one year. Thus, point 24 of the Notice on the concept of undertakings
     concerned is not applicable.
III. CONCENTRATION
5.   Ratos and 3i each hold 50 % of the shares of Woodrose. Decisions on budget, business
     plan and management require the approval of both Ratos and 3i. Hence, Woodrose is a
     jointly controlled company.
IV. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6.   The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more
     than EUR 5 billion2 (Ratos MEUR 1,115, 3i MEUR 4,018 and Atle MEUR 813). Each
     of the undertakings concerned have a Community-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250
     million, and do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate Community-wide
     turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified operation therefore has a
     Community dimension.
V.   COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
7.   On the basis of the information submitted, the Commission has only been able to
     identify one affected market, namely the wholesale market for water, heating and
     plumbing products. Atle is active in this market through its wholly owned subsidiary
     Bierregaard, which is active in Sweden and Norway. Bierregaard holds a market share
     of approximately [<10 %] in Sweden and a market share of approximately [<10 %] in
     Norway.
     Ratos is also active in this market indirectly through Dahl, which Ratos owns and
     controls jointly with the private equity company EQT. Dahl is, as far as the EEA
     territory is concerned, active as a wholesaler in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and
     Finland. Dahl’s market share is approximately [30-40 %] in Sweden, [40-50] % in
     Norway, [40-50 %] in Denmark and [20-30 %] in Finland.
     The only identified overlap between the parties’ activities is to be found in the Swedish
     and Norwegian wholesale markets for water, heating and plumbing products provided
     the relevant geographical market is deemed to be national.
2   Turnover calculated in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Merger Regulation and the Commission Notice
    on the calculation of turnover (OJ C66, 2.3.1998, p25). To the extent that figures include turnover for the
    period before 1.1.1999, they are calculated on the basis of average ECU exchange rates and translated into
    EUR on a one-for-one basis.
                                                           2

    The Commission has found no indications that de minimis overlap will raise any
    competitive concerns as Dahl is (jointly) controlled by Ratos, whereas Atle's sole
    control over Bierregaard will be transferred to 3i following a transitional period of not
    more than 12 months. During this period Ratos will not be able to influence the
    competitive behaviour of Bierregaard to any extent due to the provisions of the
    Shareholders Agreement. Thus, Ratos will not effectively take operational control over
    Bierregaard even during the initial period of joint ownership, before completion of the
    second step of the transaction. There are, furthermore, no indications that the
    transaction will result in the co-ordination of businesses of Dahl and Bierregaard.
VI. CONCLUSION
8.  For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
    Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
