 Dear Sirs,
 Subject:             Case No IV/M241 - EUROCARD/EUROCHEQUE-EUROPAY.
                      Your notification pursuant to Article 4 of                                                  Council
                      Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
 1.    On 10.06.1992 Eurocard International S.A. (ECI), Eurocheque
       International S.C. (ecISC) and Eurocheque International Holdings
       S.A. (ecIHSA) notified an operation by which they intend to create
       a new entity: Europay International S.A..
 2.    After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded
       that the proposed operation does not fall within the scope of the
       Merger Regulation.
 I. THE PARTIES AND THE PROPOSED OPERATION
 3.    ECI is a company under Belgian law managing the Eurocard system in
       Europe and in a partnership with MasterCard International on a
       worldwide basis.
 4.    ecISC is a cooperative society under Belgian law managing the
       eurocheque cheque guarantee and ATM payment system covering Europe
       and the countries bordering the Mediterranean.
 5.    ecIHSA is also a company under Belgian law, having as its main
       purpose the participation in other companies.
 6.    ecIHSA and ECI currently own 85% of European Payment Systems
       Service S.A. (EPSS) with MasterCard International holding the
       remaining 15%. EPSS offers clearing, settlement and authorisation
       services in support of intra-European and worldwide cross-border
       transactions.

                                - 2 -
7.  Europay will take over all the assets, liabilities and activities
    of ECI, ecISC and ecIHSA which will be simultaneously liquidated
    not later than the 2nd June 1993. The purpose of the new company
    is to provide payment systems and related services to licensed
    banks.
II. LACK OF COMMUNITY DIMENSION
8.  The proposed operation does not have a Community dimension since
    total worldwide turnover of the undertakings concerned does not
    exceed the 5 billion ECU threshold set out in Article 1.
III. CONCLUSION
9.  Based on the above, and regardless of whether the proposed
    operation is a concentration within the meaning of Article 3, it
    can be concluded that the notified operation does not fall within
    the scope of the Merger Regulation.
This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)a of Council
Regulation No 4064/89.
                                      For the Commission,
