Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:        Case M.7233 – Allianz/ Going concern of UnipolSai Assicurazioni
                Commission decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation
                No 139/20041
(1)     On 29 April 2014, the European Commission received a notification of a proposed
        concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 by which
        the undertaking Allianz S.p.A. ("Allianz", Italy), referred to as 'the Notifying Party',
        controlled ultimately by the Allianz Group (Germany), acquires within the meaning of
        Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation 139/2004 sole control of a non-life insurance going
        concern (the "Target", Italy) currently owned by UnipolSai Assicurazioni S.p.A.
        ("UnipolSai", Italy), by way of purchase of assets (the "Transaction").
1       OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ('the Merger Regulation'). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on
        the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') has introduced certain changes, such as the
        replacement of 'Community' by 'Union' and 'common market' by 'internal market'. The terminology of
        the TFEU will be used throughout this decision.

1.  THE PARTIES
(2) Allianz Group is a worldwide provider of financial services, active in the provision of
    life and non-life insurance, reinsurance and asset management. Allianz is a subsidiary
    of Allianz Group.
(3) The Target is a going concern consisting of a portion of UnipolSai's non-life insurance
    business and includes certain assets and liabilities of the former Milano Assicurazioni
    S.p.A, including its business division Sasa. In particular, the Target includes agency
    agreements with agencies which are currently part of the distribution network of
    UnipolSai, employees dedicated to such distribution network and non-life insurance
    portfolio policies. The Target is active in all the Italian non-life insurance market
    segments in Italy, with the exception of the credit and suretyship insurance business.
2.  THE CONCENTRATION
(4) The Transaction concerns the acquisition of sole control by Allianz of the Target,
    which is currently owned by UnipolSai. UnipolSai is a listed company solely
    controlled by the holding Unipol Gruppo Finanziario S.pA., and will remain active in
    the non-life insurance business in Italy.
(5) The Transaction will be executed as follows: (i) […].2 A legally binding Insurance
    Business Acquisition Agreement ("IBAA") was signed on 15 March 2014.
3.  EU DIMENSION
(6) The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more
    than EUR 5 000 million (Allianz Group: EUR 113 932 million, Target: EUR
    [1 100] million).3 Each of them has an EU-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250
    million (Allianz Group: EUR 77 160 million, Target: EUR [1 100] million). The
    Allianz Group does not achieve more than two-thirds of its aggregate EU-wide
    turnover within one and the same Member State, while the Target generates its entire
    EU-wide turnover in Italy.
(7) Therefore, the Transaction has an EU dimension, within the meaning of Article 1(2) of
    Regulation 139/2004.
4.  RELEVANT MARKETS
    Product Market Definition
(8) In previous decisions relating to the insurance sector, the Commission has distinguished
    between three broad categories of insurance products: life insurance, non-life insurance
    and reinsurance.4 It has also made a distinction between, on the one hand, a product
2   […].

     market for the provision of insurance products (which is segmented into three markets as
     described above) and, on the other hand, a product market for the distribution of
     insurance products. As the Target's activities are concentrated in non-life insurance,
     these markets will be analysed in the following.
     a) Non-life insurance
(9)  In previous decisions,5 the Commission noted that, from a demand-side perspective,
     non-life insurance may at least in theory be divided into as many individual product
     markets as there are different kinds of risks covered, given that characteristics, premiums
     and purposes are distinct and that there is no substitutability from the consumer’s
     perspective between different risks insured.
(10) However, the Commission has also recognised that from a supply-side perspective the
     conditions for insurance of different types of risks are quite similar and most large
     insurance companies are active in several types of risk. This suggests that different types
     of non-life insurance could be included in the same product market.6
(11) Accordingly, the Commission has in the past considered a distinction between the
     following segments: (i) accident and sickness; (ii) motor vehicle; (iii) property;
     (iv) marine, aviation and transport ("MAT"); (v) liability; (vi) credit and suretyship; and
     (vii) travel.7
(12) In some of its previous decisions,8 the Commission has also made reference to the
     applicable national insurance classification, as well as to the case practice of the
     national regulatory agencies.
(13) For this reason, the Notifying Party also provided the Commission with the relevant
     segmentation applied by the Italian Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato
     ("AGCM"), which considers that each of with 18 regulatory classes in which non-life
     insurance is categorised under Italian law amounted to a separate product market.9 Those
     18 classes are as follows: (1) accident; (2) sickness; (3) land vehicles; (4) railway rolling
     stock; (5) aircraft; (6) ships; (7) goods in transit; (8) fire and natural forces; (9) other
     damage to property; (10) motor vehicle liability; (11) aircraft liability; (12) liability for

     No. 209/2005, as amended by Legislative Decree No. 130/2012). See AGCM, Case C11524 Unipol
     Gruppo Finanziario / Unipol Assicurazioni-Premafin Fianziaria-Fondiaria SAI-Milano Assicurazioni
     of 19 June 2012; and Case C11936 Società Cattolica di Assicurazione / FATA Assicurazioni Danni of
     5 March 2014.

     ships; (13) general liability; (14) credit; (15) suretyship; (16) miscellaneous financial
     loss; (17) legal expenses; and (18) assistance.
(14) The Notifying Party argues that those 18 classes may however be reconciled with the
     Commission's case practice through the following groupings: (i) accident and illness
     (no. 1 and no. 2); (ii) motor insurance (no. 3 and no. 10); (iii) fire and other damage to
     property (no. 8 and no. 9); (iv) MAT (no. 4, no. 5, no. 6, no. 7, no. 11 and no. 12);
     (v) liability (no. 13); (vi) credit and suretyship (no. 14 and no. 15); (vii) travel (no. 18);
     and (viii) residual categories (no. 16 and no. 17).
(15) In any event, the exact product market definition for the provision of non-life insurance
     products can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise any serious doubts as to its
     compatibility with the internal market under every market definition considered.
     b) Insurance distribution
(16) In its previous decisions,10 the Commission has identified a downstream market for
     distribution of insurance products, which involves the procurement of insurance cover
     for individual and corporate customers through different distribution channels, whether
     comprised of direct writers, tied agents or intermediaries such as banks and brokers.
(17) However, the Commission has left open the question as to whether the market for
     insurance distribution comprises exclusively all outward (i.e. non-owned and third-party)
     insurance distribution channels (e.g. brokers and agents), or if the sales forces and office
     networks of insurance undertakings (constituting a direct means of sale to end-
     customers) should also fall within the market for insurance distribution.11
(18) In addition, the Commission has also considered that a distinction could be made
     between the distribution of non-life and life insurance products due to differences in the
     applicable regulatory regime and the fact that different providers are involved in the
     distribution of life and non-life insurance products.12
(19) In any event, the exact product market definition for the distribution of insurance
     products can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise any serious doubts as to its
     compatibility with the internal market under every market definition considered.
     Geographic market definition
     a) Non-life insurance
(20) In previous decisions, the Commission has generally considered the market for the
     provision of non-life insurance products and its various sub-segments as national, with
     the exception of (i) large commercial risks, such as the insurance of aerospace risks,
     which is most likely to be at least EEA-wide in scope and, (ii) the MAT insurance

     market, which is likely to be wider than national for large/multinational corporate
     customers and large risk insurance respectively.13 However, the Commission ultimately
     left the exact scope of the geographic market open.
(21) The Notifying Party agrees with the Commission's case practice and also points out such
     an approach is in line with the one adopted by the AGCM, considering the market for
     non-life insurance products and its sub-segments to be national in scope.
(22) In any event, the exact geographic market definition for the provision of non-life
     insurance products can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise any serious doubts
     as to its compatibility with the internal market under every market definition considered.
     b) Insurance distribution
(23) In previous decisions,14 the Commission, while recognising the national nature of
     insurance distribution channels, left the exact geographic market definition open, in
     particular with respect to the question as to whether the relevant geographic market
     could be wider than national.
(24) With regard to the Italian market,15 the Commission has in some of its previous
     decisions also assessed whether a narrower segmentation at a local level would be
     appropriate.
(25) The Notifying Party supports the Commission's practice with respect to the geographic
     dimension of the market for the distribution of insurance products, but explains that, in
     its case practice, the AGCM has regarded this as narrower than national, at the level of
     administrative provinces, due to the perceived lack of mobility of customers.16 In this
     regard, the Notifying Party submits that such a granular approach is inappropriate due to
     the homogeneity of (i) legislative and regulatory environments at national level; (ii) the
     competitive conditions; and (iii) the type of services provided. Moreover, the Notifying
     Party argues that the Italian market for the distribution of insurance products would be
     characterised by a chain of substitutability between the various retail spots located
     outside of the administrative borders of a given province similar to the one found by the
     Commission in Case COMP/M.5960 Crédit Agricole / Cassa di Risparmio della Spezia
     / Agences Intesa San Paolo with respect to the market for retail banking.
(26) In any event, the exact geographic market definition for the distribution of insurance
     products can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise any serious doubts as to its
     compatibility with the internal market under every market definition considered.

5.   COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
(27) While Allianz is active in the provision and distribution of both life and non-life
     insurance, the Target provides and distributes only non-life insurance in Italy.
(28) Based on the data compiled by the Italian insurance regulator (Istituto per la Vigilanza
     sulle Assicurazioni), the Transaction gives rise to horizontally affected markets in the
     segment for the provision of travel insurance and, under the segmentation applied by the
     AGCM, in classes 12 (liability for ships) and 18 (assistance). If a local dimension of the
     market for the distribution of non-life insurance is ultimately retained, the Transaction
     also leads to horizontally affected markets in 17 provinces of the Italian territory and to a
     vertically affected market between the provision non-life insurance (and sub-segments
     thereof) and the distribution of non-life insurance in the province of Trieste.
     a) Provision of non-life insurance
     Non-coordinated effects
(29) As regards the segment for the provision of travel insurance, the merged entity would
     have a market share of only [20-30]%, with a small increment of [0-5]%. The
     Transaction is unlikely to give rise to competition concerns because (i) post-Transaction,
     the merged entity will have a relatively modest market share; (ii) the increment brought
     about by the Transaction is limited; (iii) the segment is characterised by strong
     competitors such as UnipolSai ([20-30]%) and Generali ([10-20]%), as well as other
     non-negligible players such as Cattolica ([5-10]%), Axa ([0-5]%) and Reale Mutua
     ([0-5]%); (iv) over the 2010-2013 period the Notifying Party’s and the Target’s market
     shares remained relatively stable, with a slight increase of [0-5] percentage points,
     respectively; and (v) even at CR3 level, i.e. the sum of the shares of the three main
     players, the degree of concentration of this segment would remain unchanged pre- and
     post-Transaction.
(30) The same reasoning would apply mutatis mutandis to class 18 under the segmentation
     of the AGCM (assistance), because according to the Notifying Party the segment for
     travel insurance and class 18 would identify the same market.
(31) As regards class 12 (liability for ships), the merged entity wold have a market share of
     only [20-30]%, with a small increment of [0-5]%. The Transaction is unlikely to give
     rise to competition concerns because (i) post-Transaction, the merged entity will have a
     relatively modest market share; (ii) the increment brought about by the Transaction is
     limited; (iii) the segment is characterised by strong competitors such as UnipolSai
     ([20-30]%) and Generali ([10-20]%), as well as other non-negligible players such as
     Reale Mutua ([5-10]%), Axa ([0-5]%) and Cattolica ([0-5]%); (iv) over the 2010-2013
     period the Notifying Party’s and the Target’s market shares decreased by [0-5]
     percentage points, respectively; and (v) even at CR3 level, the degree of concentration of
     this segment would remain unchanged pre- and post-Transaction.
(32) Finally, the Transaction does not seem to remove a significant competitive constraint
     that previously exerted over the Notifying Party. First, the number of players in the
     market would remain unchanged post-Transaction as UnipolSai will remain an active
     player. Second, in the event of a price increase by the merged entity, this latter would
                                                   6

     risk losing customers to its competitors, which are not capacity constrained. Third, the
     applicable legislation, i.e. the so-called Bersani Legislation,17 provides that customers
     must be free to terminate their policy at no cost on an annual basis, which significantly
     lowers switching costs. Fourth, the Target can hardly be regarded as a maverick, as it has
     been - since 2002 - part of one of the biggest insurance groups in Italy and was focused
     on traditional, non-innovative distribution channels, i.e. agency as opposed to direct
     sales over the phone, internet and bancassurance agreements.
     Coordinated effects
(33) One of the respondents to the market investigation raised concerns about possible
     coordinated effects stemming from the Transaction. Indeed, the Transaction increases
     the market share of Allianz in the market for the provision of non-life insurance (and
     segments thereof) in Italy, where only three players, i.e. UnipolSai, Allianz and Generali,
     currently control around [60-70]% of this market. Nevertheless, competitive harm
     through coordinated effects is unlikely.
(34) As noted at paragraph (32), the Transaction does not reduce the number of players in the
     market for the provision of non-life insurance (and segments thereof). Post-Transaction,
     this market will continue to feature more than six players, whose market shares and
     incentives are far from being symmetric. In line with Paragraph 45 of the Horizontal
     Merger Guidelines, “it is easier to coordinate among a few players then among many.”
     Therefore, the premise to any such theory of harm would be that coordination could take
     place among the top three players. However, that is hardly merger-specific and in any
     event unlikely.
(35) Allianz, UnipolSai and Generali already control the top three positions in the market for
     the provision of non-life insurance (and segments thereof) in Italy. The Transaction does
     not alter these dynamics. Moreover, the impact of the Transaction is rather limited and
     does not justify a finding according to which - because of the transaction - coordination
     is made more likely than before. The market share increment brought about by the
     Transaction always remains below [0-5]% in all the segments of the market for the
     provision of non-life insurance.
(36) In any event, even if the Transaction increased the likelihood of coordination among the
     three top players, it cannot be concluded that any such attempt to coordinate would be
     successful. On the one hand, around [40-50]% of the market would remain in the hand
     of non-coordinating firms, which could jeopardise the outcome of the expected
     coordination. On the other hand, incentives to enter in any such coordination would not
     always be obvious. For instance, in the market for the provision of motor insurance the
     market leader UnipolSai would have - even post-Transaction - a [10-20]-percentage
     point advantage over the merged entity and an even greater advantage over Generali.
(37) Finally, the Notifying Party submits that coordination is highly unlikely because
     (i) insurance policies are an example of widely differentiated products, for which
     effective coordination is hard to achieve; and (ii) recent legislative changes aimed at
17   Law decree n. 223/2006, converted into law by Law n. 248/2006 and Law Decree n. 7/2007, converted
     into law by Law n. 40/2007.
                                                     7

     increasing competition in the Italian non-life insurance market significantly facilitate
     customers’ switching and, therefore, customers’ ability to disrupt any coordination.18
(38) In the light of the foregoing, the Transaction is unlikely to give rise to competition
     concerns in the market for the provision of non-life insurance.
     b) Distribution of insurance
(39) At national level, the merged entity's market share would remain below [20-30]% under
     every market definition considered, i.e. in both the overall insurance distribution
     segment (regrouping life and non-life insurance distribution including and excluding
     direct sales) and the segment for the distribution of non-life insurance products including
     and excluding direct sales. Therefore, the Transaction would not give rise to any affected
     markets at this geographic level.
(40) At provincial level, the merged entity's market share in the market for the distribution of
     non-life insurance products would exceed [20-30]% in 17 provinces:19 Trieste
     ([30-40]% with an increment of [0-5]%); Isernia ([20-30]% with an increment of
     [10-20]%); Benevento ([20-30]% with an increment of [5-10]%); Novara ([20-30]%
     with a market increment of [5-10]%); Aosta ([20-30]% with an increment of
     [5-10]%); Crotone ([20-30]% with an increment of [0-5]%); Livorno ([20-30]% with
     an increment of [5-10]%); Olbia ([20-30]% with an increment of [5-10]%); Bolzano
     ([20-30]% with an increment of [0-5]%); Medio Campidano ([20-30]% with an
     increment of [5-10]%); Pordenone ([20-30]% with an increment of [0-5]%); Barletta
     ([20-30]% with an increment of [0-5]%); Cremona ([20-30]% with an increment of
     [5-10]%); Foggia ([20-30]% with an increment of [0-5]%); Brindisi ([20-30]% with an
     increment of [5-10]%); and Brescia ([20-30]% with an increment of [5-10]%).
(41) However, no competition concerns are likely to arise, because (i) in most provinces the
     merged entity's market share would be relatively modest, being only slightly above
     [20-30]% (with the exception of Trieste, Isernia and Benevento where its market share
     would be around [30-40]%); (ii) in several provinces, among which Trieste where the
     merged entity achieves its highest market share, the increment brought about by the
     Transaction is small around or below [5-10]%; (iii) the merged entity will continue to
     face strong competitive pressure exerted by a wide array of actual and potential
     competitors such as Generali, UnipolSai, Aviva, Vittoria, Sara, Reale Mutua, Axa,
     HDI, Groupama and others; and (iv) in all the provinces where the merged entity's
     market share exceeds [20-30]% except Trieste (namely, Isernia, Benevento and
18   For instance, customers’ mobility in the motor liability insurance sector will be further facilitated by
     Article 34 of Law Decree n. 1/2012 (currently under implementation by virtue of a draft IVASS
     regulation) intermediaries must inform the customer, in a proper, transparent and exhaustive manner, of
     the fee and other contractual terms offered by at least three different insurance companies not belonging
     to the same groups before they can stipulate a policy.
19   Data regarding the market for the distribution of non-life insurance products at provincial level include
     direct sales. However, to the best knowledge and belief of Allianz, those data also constitute a good
     proxy of a hypothetical market for the distribution of non-life insurance products excluding direct sales.

     Novara) the market shares of Allianz and the Target have decreased over the period
     going from 2010 to 201220.
(42) Finally, the Transaction would give rise to a hypothetical vertical relationship between
     the provision of non-life insurance products (and its sub-segments) and the market for
     the distribution of non-life insurance products in Trieste. However, given the absence
     of a significant degree of market power in the upstream markets for the provision of
     non-life insurance products (below or around [20-30]%), input foreclosure of other
     downstream distributors as a result of the transaction is not likely. Conversely,
     considering (i) the merged entity's market shares in the downstream market for
     distribution of non-life insurance products in Trieste that is only slightly above
     [30-40]% and (ii) the limited impact of the Transaction (only [0-5]% increment in
     Trieste), customer foreclosure effects on upstream providers of non-life insurance
     products are equally unlikely.
(43) Therefore, the Commission concludes that the Transaction is not likely to give rise to
     any competition concerns on the market for insurance distribution.
6.   CONCLUSION
(44) For the above reasons, the European Commission has decided not to oppose the
     notified operation and to declare it compatible with the internal market and with the
     EEA Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the
     Merger Regulation.
