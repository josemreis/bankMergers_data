                                                                          SG (2003) D/228455

                                                                               MERGER PROCEDURE

                                                                                  To the notifying party:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:          Case No COMP/M.3029 – Société Générale / Axus International Hertz
                  Lease Europe
                  Notification of 9 January 2003 pursuant to Article 4 of Council
                  Regulation No 4064/891
I.   THE PARTIES AND THE CONCENTRATION
1.   On 09.01.2003, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
     pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 4064/89 by which Société
     Générale, acquires within the meaning of Article (3)(1)(b) of the Council Regulation
     control of 15 companies2 constituting the Axus International Hertz Lease Europe group
     ("AIHL Europe"), by way of purchase of shares.
2.   Société Générale is a French full-service bank of international dimension. It has
     business activities in three main areas: retail banking, asset management and
     investment banking. Société Générale has subsidiaries and/or branches in most
     Member States of the European Community. Société Générale is active in the fleet
     management services through its specialised division operating under the ALD name.

3.    AIHL Europe belongs to Axus International, a subsidiary of Ford Motor Company. It
      does business in long term company car rental and fleet management services.
4.    The proposed operation consists of the acquisition, directly or indirectly, by Société
      Générale, acting through a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries, of sole control of the
      whole of the 15 companies constituting the AIHL Europe Group. Société Générale will
      directly purchase 100% of the shares of eight of the 15 above companies.
II. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
5.    The worldwide turnover of Société Générale in the financial year 2001 was
      approximately €42.55 billion and the worldwide turnover of AIHL Europe Group for
      the year 2001 was just over €1 billion. As such, the combined worldwide turnover of
      the parties is above € 5,000 million. In addition, the two undertakings have each a EU
      turnover in excess of € 250 million: Société Générale has a EU turnover of € 32,631
      million, and AIHL Europe Group € 1,002 million. Moreover, only Société Générale
      achieved more than two thirds of its EU turnover in one single Member State, namely
      France. The concentration therefore has a Community dimension pursuant to Article
      1(2) of the Merger Regulation
III. COMPABILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
A.       RELEVANT MARKETS
6.    According to the notifying party the product market concerned by the proposed
      transaction is the market of Full Fleet Leasing and Management Services. This market
      consists mainly of light weight vehicle fleet management services provided to
      corporate clients. These services usually consist of the combination of operating leases,
      which enable customers to take their vehicle fleets off-balance sheet, and pure fleet
      management services such as insurance, repair and maintenance, fuel service, etc.
      Some customers may wish to maintain ownership of the fleet and contract for so-called
      "unfunded" fleet management services, i.e. the operating lease part of the service is not
      included.
7.    In previous decisions3 the Commission has not excluded the possibility of a market
      segmentation of the Full Fleet Leasing and Management Services market, by which
      two narrower market segments would be distinguished: (i) fleet services backed by a
      long term company car rental component ("funded" fleet management services), as
      opposed to (ii) fleet services without a long term company car rental component
      ("unfunded" fleet management services).
8.    According to these decisions these markets are at least national in scope. The parties
      propose to retain national market definitions for the purpose of this case.
9.    However, it is not necessary to further delineate the relevant product and geographic
      markets because, since in all alternative definitions considered, effective competition
      would not be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that area.

B.     COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
10. The transaction gives rise to overlap in five national markets: France, Italy, Portugal,
    Spain and United Kingdom.
11. For the overall product market, including both Full Fleet Leasing and Management
    Services, there is only one potentially affected market, in Italy, in which combined market
    share appears to be close to 15%.
12. On the basis of a distinction between "funded" fleet management services and
    "unfunded" fleet management services, the notifying party has identified two possible
    affected markets: the “funded” segment in Italy and the "unfunded" segment France.
13. In Italy, the parties account for a combined market share of 15,9% (Société Générale:
    1,7% - AIHL Europe: 14,2%) in the overall market, placing them in second place behind
    Volkswagen (Gruppo Europcar - 16,5%). They have a combined market share of 15% in
    the "funded" segment.
14. In France, the parties account for a combined market share of 33,6% (Société Générale:
    16,2% - AIHL Europe: 17,4%) in the "unfunded" segment placing them in first place
    ahead of strong players like Renault (Diac Location – 18,4%) and BNP Paribas (Arval
    PHH – 17%). The other competitors in the market belong to multinational banks or car
    manufacturers, and thus have considerable means to ensure strong competition in the
    market.
15. Moreover, AIHL Europe's "unfunded" business in France has come essentially through
    subcontracting out of fleet management services from Ford Motor Credit Company. As
    AIHL Europe will no longer form part of the Ford Motor Credit group, the "market
    share" of AIHL Europe in this case is somewhat artificial : the Ford Motor Credit
    Company will no longer subcontract systematically its fleet management services to
    AIHL, which means that these “market share” could shortly be transferred to a
    competitor of the parties.
16. In Italy and in France, the concentration brings only minor changes to the competitive
    structure of the possible affected markets and will not lead to the creation or the
    reinforcement of a dominant position whatever market definition is considered. Indeed,
    the combined activities of the parties will still face strong competition from several
    multinational banks and car manufacturers which have similar market shares and
    similar financial capacities.

IV.   CONCLUSION
17. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
    Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
