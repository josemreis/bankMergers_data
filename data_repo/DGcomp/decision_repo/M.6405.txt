                                                        To the notifying party:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:       Case No COMP/M.6405 - BANCO SANTANDER / RAINBOW
               Commission decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation
               No 139/20041
1. On 21.10.2011, the European Commission received a notification of a proposed
     concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/20042 by which
     the undertaking Banco Santander S.A. (“Banco Santander”, Spain) intends to acquire
     within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation control of parts of the
     undertaking The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (assets collectively referred to as
     "Rainbow", UK) by way of purchase of assets.3 The transaction in question was originally
     cleared by the Commission in its Decision of 15 October 2010 in case COMP/M.5948 and
     has been renotified following a change in the perimeter of the assets transferred.
I.    THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
1        OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ("the Merger Regulation"). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on
         the Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the
         replacement of "Community" by "Union" and "common market" by "internal market". The
         terminology of the TFEU will be used throughout this decision.

2. Santander is the parent company of an international group of banking and financial
    companies operating in the UK, Spain and some other European countries as well as in
    Latin America. It is active in retail banking, asset management, corporate and investment
    banking, treasury and insurance.
3. Rainbow consists of (i) the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc's ("RBS") branch-related
    retail and small and medium sized-enterprise ("SME") business in England and Wales, (ii)
    the NatWest branch-related retail and SME business in Scotland, along with (iii) certain
    mid-corporate customer accounts in the UK. In total, Rainbow consists of approximately
    300 branches and around 40 SME and business banking centres, including ATMs, together
    with related contracts, intellectual property and other related assets. Excluded from the
    scope of the transaction are insurance products, as well as financial market services.
4. On 30 August 2011, Santander and RBS amended the acquisition agreement to include
    credit and charge cards held by transferring Rainbow customers in order to avoid split
    customer relationships following closing, as well as certain Rainbow customers with cash
    handling services requirements that will be serviced by Santander post transaction ,
    together with certain other minor changes.
5.   The sale of Rainbow business results from an undertaking submitted by the UK
    authorities as part of RBS' restructuring plan following state support approved by the
    Commission in its decision of 14 December 20094. In that decision, it is stated that the
    "UK authorities commit that the buyer of the Rainbow Business must, together with the
    rest of the buyer’s group, in combination with the Rainbow Business, have a market
    share of no more than 14% in the UK SME market (on a number of customers basis),
    prior to the signing of the sale and purchase agreements relating to the sale of the
    Rainbow Business to the buyer"5.
II.   CONCENTRATION
6. The proposed transaction will result in Santander acquiring sole control over Rainbow. As
    Rainbow is not a legal entity, the transaction is structured as an asset deal, with Santander
    acquiring the branches together with related contracts, guarantees/securities and debts
    relating to customers of those branches (together with direct customer transfers), as well as
    intellectual property, goodwill, office equipment and books and records.
7. The proposed transaction constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b)
    of Regulation 139/2004.
8. As the amended acquisition agreement of 30 August 2011 has led to the change of the
    perimeter of the transaction, with the addition of additional customer relations, the
    transaction has been re-notified under the terms of the Merger Regulation.
III. EU DIMENSION

9. The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more than
    EUR 5 billion6 (Banco Santander S.A: EUR 75 325 million; Rainbow: EUR […]). Each of
    them has a EU-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (Banco Santander S.A: EUR
    […]; Rainbow: EUR […]), but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate
    EU-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified operation therefore
    has an EU dimension.
IV. RELEVANT MARKETS
10. As Rainbow is active only in retail banking and corporate banking, overlaps with the
    activities of Santander arise in banking services to private individuals and to corporate
    customers (SME and large corporate customers)7. There are also some overlaps in card
    based consumer credit and to a very minor extent also in cash handling services.
11. Regarding retail and corporate banking, the Commission in previous decisions8
    considered in particular the following relevant product and geographic markets.9
     (i) Retail Banking
12. In respect of banking services for natural persons, the following segments have been
    considered: current accounts, savings, personal loans, consumer loans, credit cards10,
    debit cards, mortgages and distribution of mutual funds and other investment products11.
    Regarding the geographic definition of retail banking markets, the Commission has
    generally considered national markets12, but has also looked at, where relevant, the
    regional distribution of branches in making its assessment.13
6   Turnover calculated in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Merger Regulation and the Commission
    Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice (OJ C95, 16.04.2008, p1).
7   As specified in recital 3, no financial market services business is included in Rainbow. However, contracts
    relating to these services are being transferred to Santander. Given that in any event Santander's presence
    in financial market services is limited with a share of less than [0-5%] in any segment, this market segment
    will not be discussed further.

    5726 - Deutsche Bank/ Sal. Oppenheim.
9   Leaving aside specialized markets which include leasing services, private banking, asset management and
    payment transaction processing. These are not analysed in the present case as according to the Parties,
    their activities in these areas do not overlap. The Commission has also looked at the markets for factoring
    and for cash handling and sales, but these markets are not affected markets in the context of the notified
    transaction.
10  In one case, COMP/M.5384 - BNP Paribas/Fortis, a separate market was identified for card-based
    revolving credit.

    Bank/Berliner Bank; COMP/M.5811 – Erste Bank/ASK.

     (ii) Card-based consumer credit
13. The Commission has considered that the provision of card-based consumer credit should
    be viewed as a separate market, distinct from card issuing and from personal loans14. In
    terms of geographic scope this market has been viewed as national.
     (iii) Cash handling and sales
14. In addition, the Parties are active in the provision of certain money transmission services
    for corporate customers. In addition to the small horizontal overlap in cash handling,
    both cash handling and cash sales may be considered an input used by financial
    institutions, even though no such relationship currently exists between Santander and
    Rainbow, and therefore a vertical relationship could in principle arise. The Commission
    has in the past15 defined a market for cash in transit ("CIT"), distinguishing it from cash
    handling services16.
15. Cash handling consists in sorting and crediting customer accounts for the value of
    physical cash (notes and coins) delivered by customers, in the case of Santander to cash
    centres or Post Office counters. Other companies provide similar services whilst some
    banks self-supply or outsource the service. The scope of the service offered may also
    extend to cheques and other bearer means of payment.
16. Cash sales consist in the provision of cash to corporate customers, financial institutions
    and ATM operators (both bank-owned ATMs and ATMs operated by independent
    operators).
17. In terms of geographic scope, in case no. COMP/M.5293 Banco Santander/Alliance &
    Leicester, although considering that it was not necessary to conclude as to the precise
    geographic scope, the Commission considered that the geographic markets for cash
    handling and cash sales were unlikely to be wider than national given, in particular, that
    cash handling and cash sales services related overwhelmingly or exclusively to national
    currency, i.e. pounds sterling.
      (iv) Banking for corporate customers
18. In respect of commercial banking services the Commission has looked at the segments
    of domestic payments, international payments, savings, loans, documentary credits,
    export financing and cash management services17. In addition, the Commission has
    made a distinction between large corporate customers ("LCCs") and smaller commercial
14  Case COMP/M.5384 BNP Paribas / Fortis, paragraph 41 et seq; see also case COMP/M.6164 Barclays
    Bank/Egg Credit Card Assets. The Commission has also left open the question of whether the provision of
    card-based consumer credit should be divided into credit offered on universal cards and credit offered on
    private label store cards, but this question is not relevant to the present case since the parties do not
    overlap in private label store cards.

    clients such as SMEs18. In cases falling under the Commission's jurisdiction, the markets
    for banking services to commercial clients have been considered national in scope while
    for LCCs the question on whether the market(s) for these services are national or wider
    in scope has been left open.
19. As regards commercial clients, the Parties have provided data on the basis of customers
    with turnover of up to GBP 25m as they have indicated that this is how both parties
    distinguish internally between SMEs and large customers19. On the other hand, SMEs
    are distinguished from retail personal customers by virtue of having a dedicated business
    account. They have, however, indicated that even if a wider definition of commercial
    clients were used (up to an annual turnover of GBP 250 million), market shares would
    be substantially unchanged20.
V.    COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
20. The proposed transaction gives rise to potentially affected markets due to horizontal
    overlaps in four segments in retail banking in the UK, on the basis of new business in
    2010: (a) personal current accounts (b) mortgages21 (c) card-based consumer credit and
    (d) cash handling22.
21. With respect to horizontal overlaps in retail banking, other than in personal current
    accounts and mortgages, the combined market shares exceed 15% in personal current
    accounts and mortgages (measured in both cases as share of new business)23, as well as
    in cash handling.
22. For personal current accounts in the UK the combined share of new business in 2010 is
    [10-20%] (Santander: [10-20%]; Rainbow: [0-5%])24.
18  M.4844 - Fortis/ABN AMRO ASSETS and Case No COMP/M.3894 – Unicredito/HVB.
19  According to the notification, a different team of relationship managers will service customers with a
    turnover above GBP 25m.
20  In M.4844 Fortis/ABN AMRO ASSETS, a turnover threshold of €250 million was applied based on the
    commercial practice of the Parties in that case.
21  If only share of total stock were taken into account there would be no horizontally affected markets.
    However, given that this measure compounds information from previous years, in particular for long-term
    assets and liabilities, the acquisition of new business is likely to be a better proxy for the effective
    competitive pressure currently exercised by the players in the marketplace.
22 The possible markets for cash handling and/or cash sales would not constitute vertically affected markets as
   Santander has a market share of [10-20%] and [5-10%] respectively. The vertical relationship in such
   markets therefore does not need to be analysed further.
23 The Parties overlap in respect of card-based consumer credit, but on any measure their combined market
    share is below [5-10%] and therefore this market is not an affected market.
24  Figures for new business in regard to personal current accounts have been provided by the Parties for 2009
    based on calculations by a third party, GFK, using a survey methodology in which customers were asked
    about new products taken out in the six months prior to the interview. According to the Notifying Party
                                                           5

23. Regarding mortgage loans, the combined share of new business in 2009 is [10-20%]
    (Santander: [10-20%]; Rainbow: [0-5%])25.
24. In both cases, a number of strong competitors exist. In personal current accounts: Lloyds
    ([30-40%]), RBS ([10-20%]), Barclays ([10-20%]), and HSBC ([10-20%]). In mortgage
    loans: Lloyds ([20-30%]), Nationwide ([5-10%]), Barclays ([10-20%]), RBS ([10-20%])
    and HSBC ([5-10%])26.
25. Even if the Commission were to consider the competitive impact at a regional level, the
    picture would not change to any significant or relevant degree27.
26. Finally, in cash handling Santander has a market share of [10-20%], and the transaction
    results in a horizontal increment to this which is, however, minimal ([0-5%]).
27. None of the possible segments in corporate banking gives rise to an affected market.
    However, as the SME market in the UK was considered specifically in the state aid
    decision regarding the restructuring of RBS it may be noted that, according to the
    notifying party, the combined market shares range between [0-5%] and [10-20%] for any
    of the possible market segments within SME banking, on the basis of SME main bank
    relationships28.
28. Given the limited combined market shares that the transaction will bring about and the
    significant number of large and credible competitors, it can be concluded that the
    transaction does not raise serious doubts on any of the possible markets.
VI. RELATIONSHIP WITH STATE AID RULES
29. Based on the information available at this stage, the Commission has no indication that
    RBS is in breach of any of its obligations regarding the sale of the Rainbow business
    within the framework of the State aid procedure29. The present decision under the EU
    there have not been any material changes as there has been no adverse change to the fascia count in any of
    the local markets where Rainbow is present.
25  According to the Parties, Santander and other players in the UK report new gross lending as a separate line
    in their annual reports and accounts, whilst the Bank of England provides total new gross lending figures
    for the overall market. As a share of stock, the figures for 2009 are [10-20%] and [10-20%] respectively.
26  All market shares quoted in terms of new business in 2010.
27  The highest combined market share provided by the Parties on the basis of possible regional segmentations
    is [10-20%] for personal loans ([…]), [20-30%] for savings and [20-30%] for mortgages ([…]).
28 This is based on PH data, also used in the state aid decision. According to the notification there are two
    primary information sources on UK SMEs and the SME market - PH and TNS. The notifying party
    considers PH is the only comprehensive source of gross market size information and that it was selected as
    the appropriate measure in the state aid process for this reason. TNS is a sample-based survey – it only
    provides information on market size by extrapolation but does provide an indicator of a cross market view
    of relative size of each player. In any event, the market shares would not vary to any significant effect if
    the TNS data were used. It should also be noted in this regard that the PH database used to collate these
    shares does not distinguish between stock and new business and therefore does not allow a separate
    calculation of new business. The data refers to 2009 as being the latest available but according to the
    Parties it is not expected to have changed to any material extent for 2010.

                                                             6

    Merger Regulation in no way prejudices, however, the ongoing monitoring of RBS'
    implementation of its obligations in line with the above decision of the Commission of
    14 December 2009.
VII. CONCLUSION
30. For the above reasons, the European Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the internal market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger
    Regulation.
