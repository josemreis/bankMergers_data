                                                             Brussels, 30.06.1995
                                                                PUBLIC VERSION
                                                                MERGER PROCEDURE
                                                                ARTICLE 6(1)(b) DECISION
                                                             To the notifying parties
Dear Sirs,
Subject: Case No.IV/M.600 - EMPLOYERS REINSURANCE CORPORATION/FRANKONA
            RÜCKVERSICHERUNGS AG
            Notification of 24 May 1995 pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 4064/89
1       On 24 May 1995 Employers Reinsurance Corporation (Employers Reinsurance) notified to
        the Commission its intended acquisition of Frankona Rückversicherungs AG (Frankona
        Rück).
2       After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
        operation falls within the scope of application of Council Regulation No 4064/89 and does
        not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and with the
        functioning of the EEA Agreement.
I      THE PARTIES
3      Employers Reinsurance is incorporated in the United States of America. Its ultimate parent
       is the General Electric Company, the head of a large and diversified industrial group. Its
       principal activity is the transaction of reinsurance business. Other companies in the General
       Electric group also supply reinsurance.

4   Frankona Rück, incorporated in Germany, is ultimately controlled by Gerling-Konzern
    Versicherungs-Beteiligungs AG (Gerling-Konzern), the head of the Gerling insurance group.
     Its principal activity is the transaction of reinsurance business.
II  THE OPERATION
5   Employers Reinsurance will acquire the 76 per cent shareholding in Frankona Rück at
    present held by the Gerling insurance group and other shareholders. It will thus acquire sole
    control of Frankona Rück. Employers Reinsurance intends if possible to obtain further
    shares in Frankona Rück.
6   The operation accordingly constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)b of
    the Regulation.
III CONCENTRATION OF COMMUNITY DIMENSION
                                                                          (1)                (1)
7   General Electric Company has a Community-wide turnover in excess of [...] . Frankona
    Rück has a Community-wide turnover of [...](2). Accordingly their combined aggregate
    worldwide turnover exceeds ECU 5000m and each of them has a Community-wide turnover
    in excess of ECU 250m. They do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate
    Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State.
8   The operation therefore has a Community dimension within the meaning of Article 1(2) of
    the Regulation.
IV  COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
a)  Introduction
9   Simultaneously with its notification of this operation Employers Reinsurance notified to the
    Commission its proposed acquisition of the non-group reinsurance business of Aachener
                                                                     (1)
    Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG (Aachener Rück).                    The assessment made in this
    decision takes into account the effect of that proposed acquisition.
b)  Relevant product market
10  Reinsurance is a particular form of insurance. Its purpose is to spread risks between insurers.
     The reinsurer accepts either the whole or part of the direct risk insured by another insurer
    and thereby provides the primary insurer with the ability to increase the amount of insurance
    which he underwrites and to diversify his risk over time and geographic area. Reinsurance is
    traded between industry specialists, it is written only with other insurance companies, no
    premium income is derived from reinsurance sales to the public and no channels for retail

    distribution are required. For these reasons the Commission has concluded in earlier
                (1)
    decisions that it is necessary to distinguish between reinsurance and direct insurance.
11  Reinsurance can be divided into two sectors - life and non-life. The non-life sector can be
    further sub-divided into the following principal categories - liability, motor,
    accident/sickness, fire, marine, aviation and other. Although some reinsurers specialise in
    particular types of cover, there is no reason apart from expertise why a reinsurer should not
    readily enter the market in any sector; there is thus a high level of supply-side
    substitutability. Since even on the narrowest market definition no competition difficulties
    arise the question whether the reinsurance market should be sub-divided can be left open.
c)  Relevant geographic market
12  Since reinsurance products are traded between industry specialists and not sold to the general
    public, controls by national authorities over the conduct of pure reinsurance tend to be much
    less extensive than those over direct insurance. This, together with the fact that reinsurance
    business can be conducted without the necessity of maintaining a large distribution force,
    tends to indicate that the market has a global character. The existence of a world market is
    also evidenced by the presence of international broking firms which mediate reinsurance on a
    worldwide scale. Within the European Union freedom of establishment to provide
    reinsurance services was enacted by Directive EEC 225/64. The Commission has in earlier
                (1)
    decisions considered the reinsurance market to be international or global.
d)  Competitive assessment
                                                                             (1)
13  In 1994 the three largest reinsurers in the world were Munich Re ([...] of the market), Swiss
                                          (1)(1)
    Re ([...](6)) and General Re ([...] ). General Electric occupied the fourth position ([...](7)),
    Frankona Rück the seventh position ([...](7)) and the business acquired by Employers
    Reinsurance from Aachener Rück the eighteenth position (([...](7)). The effect of this
    operation and of the acquisition by Employers Reinsurance of Aachener Rück is that General
    Electric displaces General Re from the third position ([...](7)). The remainder of the market is
                                                                        (7)
    highly fragmented, only five suppliers having a share above [...] . As this indicates, barriers
    to entry are low.
14  In 1994 the world market shares of the parties to the two operations for life (including heath
    and disability) reinsurance were - General Electric [...](7), Frankona Rück [...](7) and the
    business acquired by Employers Reinsurance from Aachener Rück [...](7). Their shares for
    non-life reinsurance were - General Electric [...](7), Frankona Rück [...](7) and the business
    acquired by Employers Reinsurance from Aachener Rück [...](7). In none of the categories
    liability, motor, accident/sickness, fire and other did their combined market shares exceed

     [...] . Frankona has established a strong reputation as a supplier of aviation [insurance] .
     However in both marine and aviation a comparison of the premiums received by the parties
     to the two operations in 1994 indicates that the increase in market shares resulting from the
     operation is not significant.
15   Accordingly the operation, even when it is considered together with the acquisition by
     Employers Reinsurance of Aachener Rück, does not create or enhance a dominant position.
VI   CONCLUSION
16   For the foregoing reasons, the proposed concentration does not raise serious doubts as to its
     compatibility with the common market and with the functioning of the EEA Agreement.
                                                   *

For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation and to
declare it compatible with the common market and with the functioning of the EEA Agreement.
This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation No. 4064/89.a
