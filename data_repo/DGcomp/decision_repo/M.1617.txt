Dear Madam/Sir,
Subject: Case No IV/M. 1617 – ROYAL & SUN ALLIANCE / TRYGG HANSA
             Notification of 26.07.1999 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation N/ 4064/89
1.      On 26.07.1999, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
        pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 (« ECMR ») by which
        Royal & Sun Alliance (« R&SA ») acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the
        Council Regulation control of the whole of Trygg Hansa Forsikrings AB (« THF »), via its
        subsidiary A/S Forsikringsselskabet Codan (« Codan »).
2.      After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
        operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 and does not
        raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and with the
        functioning of the EEA Agreement.
I.      THE PARTIES' ACTIVITIES AND THE OPERATION
3.      R&SA is a UK based group, active world-wide in general insurance business, life
        insurance, pension products as well as asset management. Prior to the operation, R&SA is
        already active in Sweden through its subsidiary Holmia. THF is a subsidiary of
        Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (“SEB”) an international banking group based in
        Sweden. THF is engaged in the marketing of property & casualty products in Denmark,
        Norway and Sweden.
4.      By the notified operation R&SA acquires, via its subsidiary Codan, the entire issued
        capital in THF. Through this operation R&SA acquires sole control over THF. The
        concentration is part of an overall project comprising three simultaneous transactions.

Telex: COMEU B 21877. Telegraphic address: COMEUR Brussels.

         Further to the notified acquisition of THF, R&SA agreed to dispose the banking business
         of the Codan group to SEB. In addition, both Codan and SEB concluded a joint
         distribution agreement for their life insurance businesses. Unlike the above mentioned
         acquisition of THF (first transaction), the disposal by R&SA of the banking business of the
         Codan group to SEB (second transaction) accounts for an acquired turnover below EURO
         250 million. Furthermore, the joint distribution of their life insurance businesses by both
         Codan and SEB (third transaction), does not lead to the creation of a joint venture
         performing on a lasting basis all the functions of an autonomous economic entity within
         the meaning of Art. 3 (2) of ECMR. Therefore, only the first transaction falls within the
         scope of ECMR.
II.      COMMUNITY DIMENSION
5.       R&SA and THF have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover in excess of EUR 5 000
         million (R&SA, EUR 16 353 million; THF, EUR 487 million). Each of them has a
         Community-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (R&SA, EUR [...] million; THF,
         EUR [...] million), but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate
         Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified operation
         therefore has a Community dimension, and does not constitute a co-operation case under
         the EEA Agreement, pursuant to Article 57 of that Agreement.
III.      COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
         A. Relevant product markets
6.       In most of its decisions concerning insurance companies1, the Commission distinguishes
         between life and non-life insurance and takes into consideration the fact that from a
         consumer’s point of view there is typically no substitutability between the different kinds
         of risks insured, since their characteristics premiums and purposes are distinct. In the
         present case, the notifying party follows a similar approach, defining however a market for
         Personal Health and Accident, where insurance products are provided by both life and non-
         life insurers, because policies are often sold as part of collective life and health and
         sickness insurance packages. Other insurers suggest insurance products should be further
         subdivided into private and commercial insurance. However, it is not necessary to
         delineate further the relevant product markets because, in all alternative market definitions
         considered, the operation will not lead to the creation or the strengthening of a dominant
         position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the
         EEA or any substantial part of that area.
         B. Relevant geographic markets
7.       With the exception of reassurance and insurance of certain large risks, the geographical
         dimension of the market in life and non-life insurance business is generally defined on a
         national basis2. However, it is not necessary to delineate further the relevant geographic
         markets because, even on the basis of the narrowest definition (considering national
         markets), the operation will not lead to the creation or the strengthening of a dominant
         position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the
         EEA or any substantial part of that area.

       C. Assessment
8.     The acquisition of sole control over THF by R&SA leads to horizontal overlaps in Sweden,
       Denmark and Norway. However the parties’ market shares are not significant in Norway
       (less than 5%). Through Codan, R&SA is a major player in the insurance sector in
       Denmark. Nevertheless, the overlaps concerning Building, Fire and Casualty, Householder
       and Houseowner, as well as motor insurance remain limited. In none of the Danish markets
       for property and casualty insurance has THF a market share exceeding [<5]%.
9.     R&SA is active in Sweden through Codan’s subsidiary Holmia. The notifying party
       mentions three markets in this Member State, where the overlapping activities of THF and
       R&SA (through Holmia) would lead to a combined market share of 15% or more:
       Householder and Homeowner insurance, Motor insurance and Personal Health and
       Accident. The table below summarises the respective positions of the parties and of their
       main competitors, in the three markets mentioned above3.
                                         Householder &      Motor          Personal
                                          Homeholder                   Health & Accident
           R&SA (Holmia)                  [below 5]%        [<5]%           [5-15]%
           THF                             [10-20]%       [15-25]%          [5-15]%
           Combined market share           [10-20]%       [20-30]%         [15-25]%
           Läsförsäkringar-Wasa            [25-35]%       [20-30]%          [5-15]%
           Folksam                           27.2%        [15-25]%         [25-35]%
           Skandia                           14.7%        [15-25]%         [25-35]%
10.    As regards Householder/Homeholder insurance and Motor insurance, the operation
       produces limited overlaps. Four major operators account for the bulk of the non-life
       insurance market in Sweden: Läsförsäkringar-Wasa (overall market share: [20-30]%),
       Folksam ([15-25]%), Skandia ([15-25]%) and THF ([10-20]%). This overall structure will
       not be substantially modified by the concentration. The impact of the market shares
       addition between THF and Holmia (overall market share: [<5]%) will remain limited. Even
       if THF, which ranks fourth among these majors, would be able to outplace one or the other
       of its competitors on the markets mentioned above, the respective positions of the four
       majors will remain roughly comparable as the table shows. After the concentration,
       competition will be slightly reduced by the fact that R&SA (through Holmia) will no
       longer be active as a competitor to these major suppliers, however the three largest
       suppliers will further be able to compete with the parties. In any event, a number of smaller
       competitors are likely to exercise further competitive pressure on the markets for non-life
       insurance mentioned above, among them Volvia (market share: [5-15]%), Dial ([<5]%),
       Aktsam ([y5]%), SOFAB (less than 1%) in Motor insurance, or SOFAB (less than 3%) and
       SalusAnsvar (less than 4%) in House & Home insurance4.
11.    With respect to Personal Health and Accident, where policies are provided by both life and
       non-life insurers, it can be observed that after the operation SEB will remain active on the
       market through its life insurance business. SEB will have a market share of [5-15]%, only
       resulting of its activity as a life-insurer. Since R&SA and SEB have concluded an
       agreement for the joint distribution of their life insurance products, the latter cannot be
       considered as a fully fledged competitor, although it will remain active as a separate entity.
       Even if this agreement remains subject to a separate examination under Art. 81 of the

  estimated by the parties, for 1998

       Treaty, it has to be taken into account as a fact for the purpose of the present assessment.
       However, even if it is assumed that R&SA and THF as life- and non life insurers on one
       hand, and SEB as a life-insurer on the other hand would co-ordinate their market strategy
       in a comparable way to that of an integrated group, their added market shares, [15-25] plus
       [5-15] would not be stronger than those of Folksam or Skandia ([25-35]% and [25-35]%
       respectively). Therefore, the operation does not lead to the creation of a joint dominant
       position of R&SA and SEB.
12.    Alternatively, even if the segment for non-life insurance products were to be considered as
       a separate market within the sector of Personal Health and Accident, the operation would
       neither lead to the creation nor to the strengthening of a dominant position. The combined
       market share of THF and Holmia resulting from the operation would amount to
       approximately [20-30]%, and the parties would become the second largest player on this
       segment. Nevertheless Folksam would remain market leader (with [35-45]%), in particular
       on the segment for Group Accident. Moreover, other players would be active on the life
       segment, such as SPP (market share: [5-15]%), Handelsbanken ([5-15]%) or
       Föreningssparbanken (5-15]%)5.
13.    Therefore, the proposed concentration does not create or strengthen a dominant position as
       a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any
       substantial part of that area.
IV.    CONCLUSION
14.    For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation
       and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the functioning of the EEA
       Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
       Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
