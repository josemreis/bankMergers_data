                                                                                           PUBLIC VERSION
                                                                                   MERGER REGULATION

                                                                             To the notifying parties
  Dear Sirs,
  Subject :        Case No IV/M.319 - BHF/CCF/Charterhouse
                   Your notification of 27.07.1993 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                   No 4064/89 (Merger Regulation)
  1.    On 27th July 1993 Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank (BHF) and Crédit
        Commercial de France S.A. ("CCF") notified an operation whereby they will acquire
        joint control of Charterhouse plc ("Charterhouse") a wholly owned subsidiary of the
        Royal Bank of Scotland plc ("RBS") by way of purchase of shares.
  2.    After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the
        proposed operation falls within the scope of the Council Regulation No 4064/89 and
        does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market.
  I.    THE PARTIES
  3.    BHF is a German bank whose main activities are commercial banking and financial
        services. CCF is a French bank whose main activities are commercial and retail
        banking. Charterhouse is a U.K. investment or "merchant" bank.

                                            -2-
 II. CONCENTRATION
4.   BHF and CCF will have equal shareholdings in, and an equal number of directors
     on the board of, a holding company ECF Holding, which will in turn wholly own a
     further holding company Charterhouse European Holding Ltd, ("CEHL") set up to
     acquire 90.1% of the share capital of Charterhouse. The balance of 9.9% of
     Charterhouse's share capital will be held by RBS, which will in effect remain a
     passive minority shareholder; moreover the remaining stake of RBS is subject to a
     put and call option entered into with CEHL, and exercisable two years after
     completion. RBS will retain the Capital Markets Division and private client and
     investment management business of Charterhouse. Consequently, apart from these
     latter activities of Charterhouse which are being transferred to RBS, BHF and CCF
     will have joint control of Charterhouse within the meaning of the Merger Regulation.
5.   Charterhouse is an existing undertaking engaged in investment banking. It currently
     operates as an autonomous subsidiary of RBS, with independent offices and facilities
     and after the current operation will continue to perform on a lasting basis all the
     functions of an autonomous economic entity.
6.   The activities of Charterhouse are predominantely carried out in the UK. As an
     investment bank Charterhouse is active to a varying extent in most financial services
     required by UK corporate customers. The main activities performed include general
     corporate advice, mergers and acquisitions advice, equity capital
     raising/underwriting, development capital investment and institutional stockbroking.
     Although a certain degree of harmonisation has already been reached and further
     improvements can be expected, these activities will tend for the foreseable future to
     be national in geographic scope as they usually require a detailed knowledge of
     local corporate law and business structures, accounting conventions, regulatory
     regimes and market practices. The necessity to comply with and work within the
     framework of these local constraints (stock exchange rules, for example), the need
     to work in close relationship with the customer, as well as the latter's preference for
     local banks to supply the required services make it extremely difficult for a financial
     institution to perform the above mentioned services without being physically
     established in the national market concerned.
7.   BHF and CCF perform similar investment banking activities in Germany and France
     respectively but do not provide these services in the UK. BHF has a subsidiary based
     in London, Frankfurt Consult UK Ltd, but this company employs only two executives
     and works only as a marketing outlet for advising UK companies wishing to make
     acquisitions in Germany. Similarly, CCF employs only six people in this area in the
     UK to advise UK companies on making acquisitions in France and Italy. These
     activities can not be viewed as competing with those carried out by Charterhouse.
     Anyway, BHF and CCF have agreed to close their UK activities in this area
     following the acquisition of Charterhouse.
8.   In addition to its primary investment bank activities listed in paragraph 6,
     Charterhouse, like BHF and CCF, is also active in money markets trading, foreign
     exchange trading and derivative trading. These activities whose geographical scope
     is international are part of the normal business of any bank. They are predominantly
     conducted in highly competitive inter-bank markets where there are a large number
     of players including most of the internationally active industrial companies. Most

                                            -3-
     of these operations are carried out on a day to day basis or even in real time
     through sophisticated electronic data transmission means linking the various
     operators in these markets. These activities are generally organised within each
     subsidiary of a bank on a profit center basis with a large autonomy in order to be
     able to react immediately to changing conditions of the market caused by any sort
     of events of a political, social, economical or even climatic nature. Any attempt to
     coordinate the behaviour of the players in these markets would undermine their
     speed of reaction and thus their ability to act efficiently. Therefore, the conditions
     of operation in these markets are such that any possible advantage of coordination
     of the competitive behaviour would be largely offset by its potential inconveniences.
9.   It follows from the above that Charterhouse is not an actual competitor of its
     parents, either as regards its core investment banking business where the
     undertakings concerned have activities in different national geographic markets or
     in relation to activities which are international in scope such as money markets
     operations, foreign exchange and derivatives.
     Furthermore, for the reasons mentioned in paragraphs 6 and 8, the joint venture
     cannot realistically be viewed as a potential competitor of its parents.
10. Therefore, the joint acquisition of Charterhouse by BHF and CCF is a concentration
     as the JV is an autonomous economic entity performing on a lasting basis and there
     is no coordination of the competitive behaviour of the undertakings concerned.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
11. The enterprises concerned have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover,
     calculated in accordance with Article 5(3)(a) of the Merger Regulation, in excess of
     5,000 million ECU (one-tenth of total assets of CCF 5,138 million ECU, of BHF
     2,470 million ECU and of Charterhouse 324 million ECU). Both BHF and CCF
     have a Community-wide turnover in excess of 250 million ECU but do not achieve
     more than two-thirds of their aggregate Community-wide turnover in one and the
     same Member State. The operation therefore has a Community dimension.
IV. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
12. Charterhouse's main activities are provision of advice on mergers and acquisitions,
     financial strategy, capital raising, and stockbroking in the UK (over the past five
     years [ ](1) of Charterhouse's profits have been derived from these activities).
13. Just as Charterhouse is mainly active in U.K. corporate finance markets, BHF is
     mainly active in Germany and CCF in France. In 1992 [ ](1) of BHF's total EC
     turnover was achieved in Germany and BHF's principal activity in the UK is
     corporate lending mainly to the UK subsidiaries of German companies. In 1992,
     [ ](1) of CCF's total EC turnover was achieved in France, where it carries out its
     retail banking operations (180 branches throughout France) and most of its
     investment bank activities, such as mergers and acquisitions advice, and placement

     Business secrets - over 60 %.

                                           -4-
    of new equity issues. Accordingly, there is no significant competitive overlap in these
    activities.
14. As already stated, a small proportion of Charterhouse's activities involves trading
    operations which are international in scope. However, these activities are
    predominantly for Charterhouse's own account. Moreover, although global estimates
    are difficult to calculate, Charterhouse, BHF and CCF together account for [ ](2) of
    the global daily turnover in London foreign exchange and derivatives trading.
    Therefore concerns about horizontal overlap do not arise.
15. Furthermore, the strengthening of Charterhouse by virtue of the large financial
    resources of BHF and CCF gives no cause for concern, in view of the presence of
    strong competitors in the UK corporate finance sector.
V.  ANCILLARY PROVISIONS
16. The RBS group agrees not to solicit for a period of [ ](3) from completion any person
    employed by Charterhouse in its treasury division at the date of the agreement. The
    purchasers and their subsidiaries also agree not to solicit for the same period any
    person employed in Charterhouse's former capital market division at the date of the
    agreement. The capital market division is being retained by RBS. Following the
    division of the stockbroking business of Charterhouse, the parties, the RBS group on
    the one hand and the Charterhouse group on the other hand, also agree not to solicit
    former employees of the institutional and private client stockbroking businesses
    respectively for a period of [ ](3) following completion of the sale of the private
    client business to RBS. These restrictions are necessary in order to allow the above-
    mentioned businesses to establish themselves on the market independently.
17. RBS agrees for the period between the date of the agreement and completion that the
    Charterhouse group business will be carried on in the ordinary course and that it
    will not take certain major decisions or make certain changes without the
    purchaser's consent. Charterhouse agrees that the stockbroking business will be
    carried on in the ordinary course prior to completion of the sale of the private client
    stockbroking business to RBS.
18. Charterhouse grants a non-exclusive licence of software, and provides certain
    services, to a subsidiary of RBS which currently manages certain pension funds on
    behalf of Charterhouse (and which will continue to do so). The agreement contains
    certain provisions as to the confidentiality of the software and data. The agreement
    is concluded for an initial period of 6 months and shall continue thereafter unless
    and until it is terminated by either party upon six month's notice. The Commission
    acknowledges that in order to make possible the transfer of the assets under
    reasonable conditions it is often necessary to maintain at least for a transitory period
    such service links between the vendor and the JV. However, in this case, as the
    parties have not put forward convincing arguments justifying the objective need for
    an agreement of a potentially indefinite duration, it is considered that these

                                          -5-
    agreements are only covered by the present decision for a period of three years
    following completion.
19. Certain permissions and prohibitions concerning the use of the corporate/business
    names "Charterhouse" and "Tilney" have been agreed between RBS and
    Charterhouse. These clauses are designed to ensure the full transfer to the
    purchasers of the assets (including goodwill) of the businesses being acquired.
20. Charterhouse agrees to grant a perpetual royalty-free non-exclusive licence to RBS
    of certain existing software and certain software which is currently being developed
    to replace the existing software aimed to assist dealers and to record dealing
    transactions. Charterhouse agrees only to use the existing software for its own
    purposes. The agreement contains certain provisions as to the confidentiality of the
    software and related data. The existing software is currently being used by both
    Charterhouse's treasury division and the capital markets division, the latter being
    retained by RBS and therefore not part of the operation. These provisions are
    directly related and necessary to the division of the two businesses.
21. Finally, a non-competition covenant is to be entered into by the notifying parties not
    to compete with the joint venture in relation to corporate finance business in the UK
    as long as they jointly control Charterhouse. This restriction expresses the parties'
    intention to concentrate their future UK activities in this area in Charterhouse.
22. These agreements are directly related and necessary to the implementation of the
    concentration and are therefore ancillary within the meaning of the Regulation.
VI. CONCLUSION
23. It follows from the above that the proposed concentration would not create or
    strenghten a dominant position as a result of which competition would be
    significantly impeded in the common market or in a substantial part of it.
                                            *
                                        *       *
    For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    concentration and to declare it compatible with the common market. This decision
    is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
