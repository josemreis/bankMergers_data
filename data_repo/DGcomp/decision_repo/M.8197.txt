Dear Sirs,
Subject:     Case M.8197 - CINVEN / OLD MUTUAL WEALTH ITALY
             Commission decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC)
                             1                                                                            2

1.   On 16.09.2016, the European Commission received notification of a proposed
     concentration pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation by which Ergo Previdenza
     S.p.A (Italy), controlled by Ergo Italia S.p.A. (Italy) and ultimately by Cinven Capital
     Management (V) General Partner Limited, belonging to the Cinven group ("Cinven", UK)
     acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation control of the
     whole of Old Mutual Wealth Italy S.p.A. (Italy), a wholly owned subsidiary of Old Mutual
     Wealth Holdings Limited (UK), ultimately owned by Old Mutual Group Plc (UK) by way
     of purchase of shares.3
2.   The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
         - Cinven is a private equity firm with investments in: business services; consumer
              goods and services; financial services; healthcare; industrials; and technology,
              media and telecommunications. It is active on the Italian life insurance market,
              both as a provider and a distributor, through its portfolio company Ergo Italia.
         - Old Mutual Wealth Italy is a provider of life insurance, active only on the Italian
              market.
3.   After examination of the notification, the European Commission has concluded that the
     notified operation falls within the scope of the Merger Regulation and of paragraph 5(c) of
1    OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 (the 'Merger Regulation'). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on the
     Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') has introduced certain changes, such as the replacement of
     'Community' by 'Union' and 'common market' by 'internal market'. The terminology of the TFEU will be used
     throughout this decision.

   has decided not to oppose the notified operation and to declare it compatible with the
   internal market and with the EEA Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of
   Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation and Article 57 of the EEA Agreement.
                                                   For the Commission
