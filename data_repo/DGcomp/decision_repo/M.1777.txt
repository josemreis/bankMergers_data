                                                                     To the notifying party
Dear Sirs,
Subject: Case No COMP. 1777- CGU/HIBERNIAN
             Notification of 9.12.1999 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
             No 4064/89
1. On 9 December 1999, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
     concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/891 by
     which CGU plc. takes sole control of Hibernian Group plc. by way of recommended
     cash offer by CGU for all the issued and to be issued ordinary shares in Hibernian not
     already owned by it (the group already held 28% of the issued ordinary shares of
     Hibernian).
2. After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
     operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 and does
     not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and with the
     functioning of the EEA Agreement.

I.    THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
3. CGU provides all classes of insurance and life assurance, in the UK, Continental
    Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and other countries throughout the world.
    CGU provides also other related financial services. Hibernian provides the same
    products almost entirely in Ireland and, to a minor extent, in Continental Europe.
4. On 19 November 1999 CGU launched a cash offer for all issued and to be issued
    ordinary shares in Hibernian not already owned by de CGU Group (the CGU Group
    already held 28% of the issued ordinary shares of Hibernian). The offer has been
    unanimously recommended by the Independent Directors of Hibernian.
II. CONCENTRATION
5. The transaction constitutes an acquisition of sole control by CGU of Hibernian within
    the meaning of Article 3 of the Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6. The combined aggregate world-wide turnover of the undertakings concerned
    exceeded 5,000 million EURO in the last financial year (CGU: 21,800 million
    EURO; Hibernian: 397 million EURO). Each of them has a Community-wide
    turnover in excess of ECU 250 million (CGU, EURO 17,100 million; and Hibernian,
    EURO 387 million), but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate
    Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified
    operation therefore has a Community dimension. It does not constitute a co-operation
    case under the EEA Agreement, pursuant to Article 57 of that Agreement.
IV. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
      A. Relevant product markets
7. Following the practice of the Commission assessing cases in the insurance sector 2,
    there are three major market segments: general insurance, life insurance and
    reinsurance. According to the parties, within the general insurance segment, arguably
    there is a distinct product market for each separate category of risk. The parties
    submit that within the general insurance sector the main risk categories should be
    grouped under two main headings, personal and commercial. Life insurance should
    be subdivided into three categories: life assurance policies, investment policies and
    pensions. Other insurance markets would include marine, aviation and goods in
    transit insurance. Reinsurance includes treaty reinsurance, which involves reinsurance
2 M.1719- Delta Lloyd Verzekeringsgroep/Nuts Ohra, M.1499 - Swiss Life/Lloyd Continental, M.1498 –
    Aegon/TransAmerica, M.1453 AXA/GRE and others
                                                   2

    of a portfolio of business, covering a number of risks and facultative reinsurance,
    which involves reinsurance on an individual policy basis.
8. However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
    product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
    does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
    competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that
    area.
B.   Relevant geographic markets
9. The notifying party states that the relevant geographic markets are national (insurance
    to individuals and retail banking related services), and global (re-insurance, marine,
    aviation and goods in transit insurance).
10. However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
    product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
    does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
    competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that
    area.
    C. Competitive assessment
11. Although CGU’s principal operations are in the UK and to a lesser extent in a range
     of other Member States including Ireland, Hibernian is essentially only active in
     Ireland, having sold its UK general insurance business in 1998. According to the
     parties the affected markets, followed by market shares, will be, commercial motor
     vehicle [between 20% and 25%], property insurance, both household and
     commercial [between 20% and 25% and between 25% and 30%], employers liability
     [between 15% and 20%] and fidelity guarantee [between 40% and 50%].
12. Fidelity guarantee, that is insurance against loss through behaviour of employees
     such dishonestity, constitutes a sub-segment of pecuniary loss insurance, a small and
     somewhat unusual niche market in Ireland. The parties estimate total gross
     premiums written on this market per annum at around EUR 14 m. [Both parties
     derive a large percentage of their premium income on this market from a single
     source]. Any market player could offer this service and the proposed merger will not
     alter Hibernian’s existing position.
13. There are strong competitors present in all segments of the Irish general insurance
     business including Allianz, AXA, Royal & Sun and Eagle Star (Allied Zurich).
     There are also a number of strong companies, in particular brokers and financial
     institutions, active in the distribution channels on the Irish market.
14. Consequently, the proposed concentration does not create or strengthen a dominant
     position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in
     the EEA or any substantial part of that area.
                                                  3

VI.   CONCLUSION
15. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
    Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
