To the notifying party:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:        Case M.7207 - CLAYTON DUBILIER & RICE / ASHLAND WATER
                TECHNOLOGIES
                Commission decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation
                No 139/20041
(1)         On 2 May 2014 the European Commission received notification of a proposed
            concentration pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation by which Clayton,
            Dubilier & Rice Fund IX, L.P. ('CD&R Fund IX', US) acquires within the meaning
            of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation sole control over entities and assets that
            comprise Ashland Water Technologies ('AWT', US) […]. CD&R Fund IX is
            referred to as the "Notifying Party". CD&R Fund IX and AWT are collectively
            referred to as "the Parties".
1.          THE PARTIES
(2)         CD&R Fund IX is a private equity fund formed to make investments in companies
            active in a variety of economic sectors. It is ultimately and solely controlled by
            Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Group (“CD&R”), a private equity investment group
            based in the U.S. which originates, structures and frequently acts as lead equity
1         OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ('the Merger Regulation'). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on
          the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') has introduced certain changes, such as the
          replacement of 'Community' by 'Union' and 'common market' by 'internal market'. The terminology of
          the TFEU will be used throughout this decision.

      investor in management buyouts, strategic minority equity investments and other
      strategic investments.
(3)   AWT is currently one of four commercial units of Ashland Inc., US. It is based in
      the US and has operations worldwide. AWT is a supplier of specialty chemicals
      and provides services to the pulp, paper, mining, food and beverage, power
      generation, refining, chemical processing, general manufacturing and municipal
      industries. Within its two lines of business (that is, Pulp and Paper, and Industrial
      Water), AWT also supplies performance-based feed and control systems,
      proprietary monitoring devices and remote system surveillance. In addition, AWT
      offers consulting services in relation to utility products, chemicals and plant assets,
      as well as advice on minimising energy, water and other operational costs.
2.    THE OPERATION AND THE CONCENTRATION
(4)   The transaction consists in the acquisition of indirect sole control over AWT […],
      by CD&R Fund IX, through […], an entity established especially for the purposes
      of this transaction. Therefore the transaction constitutes a concentration within the
      meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
3.  EU DIMENSION
(5)   The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of
      more than EUR 5 000 million2 [CD&R : EUR […] million; AWT: EUR […]
      million]. Each of them has an EU-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million
      [CD&R: EUR […] million; AWT: EUR […] million] and they do not achieve more
      than two-thirds of their aggregate EU-wide turnover within one and the same
      Member State. The notified operation therefore has an EU dimension.
4.    COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
(6)   The notified transaction does not result in any horizontal overlaps. However, it
      gives rise to vertical overlaps, between the activities of AWT and two of CD&R's
      portfolio companies, respectively Univar (US) and SPIE (France)3, i.e. between the
      distribution of chemicals (upstream markets) and the supply of process chemicals
      (downstream markets) and between the supply of water treatment products
      (upstream market) and facility management (downstream market).
2   Turnover calculated in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Merger Regulation and the Commission
    Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice (OJ C95, 16.04.2008, p1).
3   None of the other CD&R controlled companies are active in the EU on a market which is vertically
    related to the markets on which AWT is active.
                                                    2

4.1.      Market definition
4.1.1.    Supply of chemicals to the paper industry
(7)       In previous decisions4 the Commission has distinguished between the supply of
          chemicals (i) to the paper industry and (ii) for water treatment in general.
(8)       The same decisions concluded that the chemical products used in the paper
          manufacturing process can be subdivided into (i) commodity chemicals, (ii) process
          chemicals and (iii) functional chemicals. AWT is active only in process chemicals
          and functional chemicals.
(9)       As regards process chemicals (that is, chemicals used to improve the efficiency of
     the production process), AWT produces […] defoamers and contaminant control agents.
     As regards functional chemicals, AWT is active […] in the supply of surface sizing
     agents.
          4.1.1.1. Process chemicals (defoamers and contaminant control agents)
(10)      The Commission has previously analysed the market of supply of defoamers and
          the market of supply of contaminant control agents as separate markets.5 The
          Notifying Party agrees with this definition.
(11)      In the same decision6 the Commission has considered the geographic market for
          both the supply of defoamers and of contaminant control agents as EEA-wide.
(12)      In the present case both the product and geographic market definition for the supply
          of defoamers and the supply of contaminant control agents can be left open since
          the notified transaction would not give rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility
          with the internal market under any plausible market definition.
          4.1.1.2. Functional chemicals (sizing agents)
(13)      The Commission in its previous decisions7 has indicated that sizing agents could be
          further segmented into internal and surface agents and that within the segment of
          internal agents, a delineation could be made between AKD, ASA and rosin sizes,
          but ultimately left the market definition open. The Notifying Party submits that
          internal and surface agents are substitutable across a wide range of applications and
          so are viewed as being part of the same market.
(14)      In the same decisions,8 the Commission considered that the relevant geographic
          market is no wider than, and most likely, EEA-wide.

(15)    In the present case both the product and geographic market definition for the supply
        of sizing agents can be left open since the notified transaction would not give rise
        to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under any plausible
        market definition.
4.1.2.  Supply of chemicals for water treatment
(16)    As far as water treatment in general is concerned, in the past the Commission
        distinguished between (i) chemicals for municipal water treatment and (ii)
        chemicals for industrial water treatment.9
        4.1.2.1. Chemicals for municipal water treatment
(17)    Apart from the fact that the Commission has previously considered chemicals for
        municipal water treatment to be different from chemicals for industrial water
        treatment, the Commission has not previously analysed this market. The Notifying
        Party suggests that the major difference between the two types of water treatment
        chemicals is that municipal applications require little or no servicing work apart
        from the chemical treatment of the water, whereas industrial applications require
        the intervention of specialised technical personnel. In addition, the Notifying Party
        submits that chemicals for municipal water treatment could be further segmented
        into chemicals for municipal wastewater treatment and chemicals for potable water
        treatment. However, in this case, the product market definition pertaining to
        chemicals for municipal water treatment can be left open as the transaction does
        not give rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under
        any possible plausible market definition as AWT is active […] in chemicals for
        municipal wastewater treatment.
(18)    As regards the relevant geographic market, the Notifying Party submits that both
        the market for the supply of chemicals for industrial water treatment and the market
        for the supply of chemicals for municipal water treatment is EEA-wide in scope.
(19)    In the present case both the product and geographic market definition for the supply
        of chemicals for municipal water treatment can be left open since the notified
        transaction would not give rise to serious doubts as to the compatibility with the
        internal market under any plausible market definition.
        4.1.2.2. Chemicals for industrial water treatment
(20)    While within the market for the supply of chemicals for industrial water treatment
        the Commission has concluded that there is no need to differentiate between
        industries, in several cases the Commission distinguished between the following
        categories of different chemicals used in industrial water treatment: (i) chemicals
        for influent and effluent water treatment and (ii) chemicals for water cooling and
        boiling applications.10

                                                       4

       A. Influent and effluent water treatment
(21)   In a previous decision11, the Commission noted that the market for influent and
       effluent water treatment chemicals comprises both coagulants and flocculants. It
       further considered distinguishing between the physical forms in which influent and
       effluent water treatment chemicals are sold (dry powders, dry beads, liquid
       dispersion and emulsions) and the organic or inorganic character of such chemicals.
       However, the precise market definition was left open.
(22)   In the same decision,12 the Commission considered that the geographic scope of the
       market for water chemicals for the treatment of influent and effluent water could be
       considered EEA-wide in scope, although it ultimately left the question open.
(23)   In the present case, both the product and geographic market definition can be left
       open since the notified transaction would not give rise to serious doubts as to its
       compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market definition.
       B. Chemicals for water cooling and boiling applications
(24)   In a recent decision,13 the Commission considered that water treatment chemicals
       for cooling and boiler applications can further be segmented according to the
       industry of application (e.g. food and beverages, paper or energy) and to the
       specific chemicals used (e.g. corrosion chemicals, scale inhibitors, dispersant
       agents or biocides).
(25)   In the same decision, the Commission considered that the geographic market is
       EEA-wide.14
(26)   In the present case, both the product and geographic market definition can be left
       open since the notified transaction would not give rise to serious doubts as to its
       compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market definition.
       4.1.3. Chemicals distribution
(27)   In previous decisions15 the Commission has distinguished three relevant product
       markets in the chemicals distribution sector: (i) the market for bulk chemicals
       (“trading”), (ii) the market for the distribution of commodity chemicals
       (“commodities”) and (iii) the market for the distribution of specialty chemicals
       (“specialties”).
(28)   In previous cases,16 the geographic markets for all three segments were considered
       to be at least national in scope. Some markets, such as the United Kingdom and

         Ireland or Nordic countries, are considered to be at least regional in scope due to
         the fact that a group of countries is served from the same warehouse.17 The
         Notifying Party agrees with this definition.
(29)     However, in the present case, both the product and geographic market definition
         can also be left open since the notified transaction would not give rise to serious
         doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market
         definition.
4.1.4.   Facility management
(30)     Facility management services comprise a broad variety of auxiliary support services
         to companies. In previous decisions, 18 the Commission has considered it possible
         to distinguish between: (a) technical facility management; (b) commercial facility
         management; and (c) general facility management.
(31)     The geographic market for all three types of facility management was considered
         EEA-wide.
(32)     In the present case, both the product and geographic market definition can also be
         left open since the transaction would not give rise to serious doubts as to its
         compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market definition.
4.2.     Competitive assessment
(33)     The Notifying Party submits that there are no horizontal overlaps, and the only
         vertical relationships arising, between AWT, Univar and SPIE, that is between (i)
         the distribution of chemicals (upstream markets) and the supply of process
         chemicals (downstream markets) and (ii) the supply of water treatment products
         (upstream market) and facility management (downstream market) do not involve
         significant market shares on either the upstream or downstream markets,.
(34)     Concerning the vertical relationship arising between the distribution of chemicals
         (upstream markets) and the supply of process chemicals (downstream markets),
         according to data submitted by the Notifying Party, the Parties' combined market
         shares are less than [20-30]%, with the exception of AWT's market shares on the
         market of supply of contaminant control chemicals to the paper industry, where it
         reaches a market share of [30-40]% in the EEA. This is the only affected market
         resulting from the proposed transaction.
(35)     The Notifying Party argues that there is no risk of input foreclosure, because firstly
         Univar is not a major player in the upstream markets, either on the commodities
         distribution market or on the speciality distribution market, its market shares being
         consistently below [10-20]%, except for the four Nordic countries (Denmark,
         Finland, Norway and Sweden) where they reach [20-30]% [….]. Second, AWT
         purchases around [90-100]% of its needs directly from the chemical companies
         themselves and only [0-5]% from distributors. Third, potentially foreclosed

                                                   6

        competitors of AWT could either look for another supplier, or also buy directly
        from the chemical companies. Finally, the Notifying Party underlines that while
        AWT will be under sole control of CD&R, Univar is jointly controlled by CD&R
        and […]. […] to lose some degree of sales (and profits) for Univar in order to
        achieve a competitive advantage for AWT.
   (36) Along the same lines, the Notifying Party argues that there is no risk of customer
        foreclosure, given that AWT is not an important customer for chemicals sold by
        distributors, given that under all scenarios, the volumes it sources through this
        channel represent well below [0-5]% of the sales by chemical distributors in the
        EU.
   (37) Indeed, considering the relatively low market shares of Univar in the upstream
        market, the presence of other important competitors, like Kemira ([20-30]% market
        share), Nalco ([10-20]% market share), BASF ([5-10]% market share) and also the
        small percentage that AWT purchases from distributors for its needs, the proposed
        transaction is unlikely to raise any competition concerns.
   (38) As regards the vertical relationship arising between the supply of water treatment
        products (upstream market) and facility management (downstream market), the
        Notifying Parties submit that there are no affected markets. The market shares of
        both AWT and SPIE in their respective markets are significantly lower than 30%
        and SPIE only purchases minor amounts of water treatment chemicals for its
        facility management business. Hence the resulting vertical relationship is minor and
        unlikely to raise any competition concerns.
5.      CONCLUSION
   (39) For the above reasons, the European Commission has decided not to oppose the
        notified operation and to declare it compatible with the internal market and with the
        EEA Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the
        Merger Regulation.
