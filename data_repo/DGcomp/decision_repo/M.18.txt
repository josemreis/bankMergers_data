                                                                           2. Notifying party
 Dear Sirs,
 Subject: Case No. IV/M018 - AG/Amev
 After full examination of your notification, the Commission has
 come to the conclusion that the notified operation falls within the
 scope of Council Regulation No. 4064/89 and does not raise serious
 doubts as to its compatibility with the common market.
 I.       Concentration
 1.       The notified operation envisaged by Compagnie Financière et de
 Réassurance du Groupe AG (AG) and N.V. Amev will be completed as
 follows: all interests and activities of both groups will be
 brought under two subholding companies (respectively AG 1824,
 Belgische Maatschappij van Algemene Verzekeringen, and Amev/VSB
 1990 N.V.). AG and Amev will each take 50 % of the shares of these
 subholdings and both parent companies will merely continue to exist
 as independent holding companies. Both the subholding companies
 will operate as one single group under one single management. The
 decision-making bodies of the new group (Supervisory Committee,
 Management Committee, Co-ordinating Committee) will be composed of
 an equal number of members respectively appointed by AG and Amev.
 2.       Since AG and Amev will bring all activities, on a lasting
 basis, into the new, jointly controlled group the operation
 constitutes a merger from an economic point of view and the
 acquisition by AG and Amev of 50 % in each other's subholdings has
 to be considered as a concentration within the meaning of Article
 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
                                             Rue de la Loi 200 - B-1049 Brussels - Belgium

                               - 2 -
II. Community dimension
3.   The operation in question raises a legal issue as to the
calculation of the turnover for insurance companies.       It is a
common practice that insurance companies invest part of the
premiums received in real estate as a means of cover for technical
reserves. If the turnover of AG's and Amev's insurance activities
is calculated by excluding the turnover realised by the companies
active in the real estate sector and belonging to the groups AG and
Amev, then the aggregate worldwide turnover of both groups, in
1989, is only 4,903 million ECU. Whereas, if the turnover of real
estate companies is included, the worldwide turnover is 5,053
million ECU and, therefore, the threshold of Article 1(2)(a) is
met.
4.   The parties argue mainly that the real estate investments as
well as other investments are inherent in the insurance activities
and that therefore the financial results of these investments
should not be taken into account since the special rule for
calculating the turnover of insurance companies, laid down in
Article 5(3)(b), applies. They point out that there is a legal
obligation for insurance companies to invest the acquired premiums
and that it would be arbitrary to treat the turnover from real
estate in the framework of Article 5 differently from the turnover
from other investment categories.
5.   This argument is not convincing. Article 5(3)(b) states that
for insurance undertakings the value of gross premiums shall be
used in place of turnover. This provision does not constitute a
special threshold for insurance companies, but only a special
method of calculation of turnover and does not exempt them from the
general rules stated in Article 5. Article 5(4) provides for the
turnover of an undertaking itself and the other companies belonging
to the same group. If an insurance company conducts other kinds of
business through a subsidiary, this business generates a turnover
which has to be added to the turnover of the insurance company
itself (i.e. its gross premium income).       In this case, it is
irrelevant that the capital of the subsidiary is raised by the
insurance company out of its technical reserves. For the purpose
of the thresholds laid down in Article 1, the aims and methods of
generating turnover are immaterial.
6.   The turnover of AG and Amev has, therefore, to be calculated
including the turnover achieved by their real estate companies.
Hence it follows that the 5 billion ECU threshold is met. Since
the other requirements of Article 1(2) are also fulfilled, the
notified operation has a Community dimension within the meaning of
Article 1.
III. Compatibility
7.   The insurance companies Amev and Group AG are major providers
of insurance services with significant market positions especially
in their home markets, in the Netherlands and in Belgium
respectively.   As the parties are to a large extent active on
geographically complementary markets and do not create or
strengthen a dominant position on markets where they are
competitors, their merger does not raise doubts as to its
compatibility with the common market.

                               - 3 -
1.   Relevant markets
a.   Service market
9.   Amev and Group AG are mainly active in the insurance business.
Both groups also have interests in banks, Amev in the Dutch VSB
Groep N.V. and Group AG in the Belgian Metropolitan S.A. But there
is very little geographical overlap in the banking activities of
these companies and the market shares do not go beyond 5 % with the
exception of one market (credit cards in the Netherlands). The
impact of the merger on competition in banking markets is therefore
insignificant and can be ignored.
10. Amev and Group AG offer a wide range of insurances mainly to
the final consumer to cover all kinds of risks.        The parties
distinguish between up to 19 different insurances across the life
and non-life (damage) sector. The most important insurances with
regard to volume of premiums are life, automobile, fire, general
liability and accidents. Amev and Group AG suggest the existence of
as many relevant service markets as there are insurances for
different kinds of risks.     It can be left open     whether this
suggestion is correct, because even on this narrow market
definition the merger does not raise serious doubts.
b.   Geographical market
11. The activities of both companies in the insurance business are
geographically widely spread.     Within the EEC they offer their
services in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, the
United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Denmark. However, most of the
gross premium income stems from only the two countries, Belgium and
the Netherlands.
12. The relevant geographical markets for the insurances in
question seem to be the national markets of each Member State:
-    Risk levels vary due to different legal environments and
social security systems.
-    Distribution systems vary from Member State to Member State.
-    Public supervision and regulation of markets (inter alia for
     tax reasons) differ. Freedom to establish and provide cross-
     border services has not yet been fully effective. So far only
     Council Directive 88/357 for the non-life sector with regard
     to large risks has entered into force.
13. Again, the question of the relevant market can remain open.
Even on the arrow basis of national insurance markets, which the
parties claim to be the relevant geographical markets, the merger
does not raise serious doubts.
2.   Market shares
14. The merger of Amev and Group AG mainly concerns competition in
the insurance markets of the Netherlands and Belgium.           The
aggregate market shares of the parties in the insurance markets of
France, Denmark and Ireland are below 3 %.           A significant
impediment to effective competition on these markets through the
merger is, therefore, unlikely. The same is true for the insurance
markets in Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and Spain. The market
shares of either Amev or Group AG are partly above 3 % on some of
these markets.   But, as only one of the companies concerned is

                                - 4 -
active on each of these markets and the market shares held by one
of them do not exceed % (1) (travel insurance, United Kingdom), the
merger is not detrimental to the structure of competition on these
markets.
a.   The Dutch insurance markets
15. Although Amev is one of the largest providers of insurances in
the Netherlands besides Nationale Nederlanden and Aegon, it holds,
in general, market shares in the range of only % (2) to % (2).  Its
market share is considerably higher only in one market, called
"Spaarkasbedrijf".    The service provided in this market is a
combination of a risk insurance and a savings scheme.          Amev
introduced this service a few years ago, created a niche market and
remains the market leader with a %(3). market share as of today.
Except for this market, the Dutch insurance markets are moderately
concentrated.
16. Groupe AG is active on only two Dutch insurance markets where
it is an almost insignificant competitor with market shares of %
(life insurance) and % (fire and other damage to property). The
creation or strengthening of a dominant position on these markets
through the merger of Amev and Groupe AG can therefore be excluded.
With regard to the Dutch insurance markets, the merger does not
give rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common
market.
b.   The Belgian insurance markets
17. Groupe AG ranks first among the major Belgian insurance
companies. It is closely followed by Royale Belge. The company is
particularly strong in the following four markets: life insurance,
medical care, disability and fire insurance. It is, in all four
markets, the market leader with market shares above 10 %. In two
of these markets, Groupe AG holds market shares well beyond this
level: % for other damage to property and % for disability.
18. Apart from the aforementioned markets, all other Belgian
insurance markets are less concentrated.      The market shares of
Groupe AG do not surpass the 10 % threshold.
19. The significance of relatively high market shares for the
appraisal of a merger depends, to a considerable extent, on the
barriers to entry to the relevant market.      It is reasonable to
assume that there are significant entry barriers to the Belgian
insurance markets, as indeed to other insurance markets in the
Community:
-    Legal requirements and prudential rules call for substantial
     resources of a newcomer in capital and financial reserves.
-    Return on investment is slow in the initial phase after entry.
     There are high start-up costs for promotion and advertising.
-    Competitors in neighbouring geographical markets are not yet
     fully free to offer cross-border services (see above).
20.  For all these reasons, there are relatively few new entrants

                                  - 5 -
to the Belgian insurance markets, as has been confirmed by the
notifying parties.
21. Although the barriers to entry underline the strong position
Groupe AG holds in some Belgian insurance markets, the creation or
strengthening of a dominant position through the merger with Amev
is not likely.
22. Amev is, like Groupe Ag in the Dutch markets, only a minor
competitor on the Belgian insurance markets. The merger does not
change the market position of Groupe AG in a way that it is not
compatible with the common market.        Amev does not offer a full
range of insurances in Belgium. Where Groupe AG is strongest - in
the market for disability insurances with a % (4) market share - Amev
does not operate.    In the other market where Groupe AG holds a
strong position with a % (5) market share (other damage to property),
Amev has a market share of only % and is, therefore, an
insignificant competitive force. In this market, as in all the
other markets where both parties are competitors, the gap with
regard to market shares between Groupe AG and its nearest
competitor (which is never Amev) remains quite narrow. This will
not substantially change after the merger. Furthermore, there are
other competitors with considerable financial resources and
experience besides Groupe AG and Amev, like Royale Belge, la
Baloise, DKV, Axa, Smap/Omob, Cger/Aslk, Cigna and Assubel. Where
the market share of Groupe Ag does not surpass the 10 % level,
Amev's market share does not exceed 2 %.
23. The establishment of a link between Groupe AG and Royal Belge
through the merger with Amev, the latter having a joint venture
with Royale Belge in the French insurance market, does not
significantly impede effective competition among them. (Three
sentences deleted here). Given the very limited scope of the joint
venture, it will not have an appreciable impact on competition in
Belgian markets.

For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose
the notified operation and to declare it compatible with the
common market.
This decision is adopted in application of Article 6, paragraph
1(b) of Council Regulation No. 4064/89.
