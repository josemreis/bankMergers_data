To the notifying parties
Dear Sirs,
Subject:      COMP/M.5241 - AMERICAN EXPRESS/ FORTIS/ ALPHA CARD
              Notification of 29 August 2008 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
              No 139/20041
1.    On 29.08.2008 the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
      pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 by which the
      undertaking American Express Company (‘American Express’, U.S.) and Fortis Bank
      S.A. / N.V. (‘Fortis’, Belgium) acquire within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the
      Council Regulation joint control of the undertaking Alpha Card S.C.R.L./ C.V.B.A.
      (‘Alpha Card’, Belgium) by way of restructuring a joint venture.
I.    THE PARTIES
2.    American Express is active in payment card issuing and merchant acquiring
      worldwide.
3.    Fortis is an international provider of banking and insurance services to personal,
      business and institutional customers.
4.    Alpha Card is issuing American Express branded payment cards in Belgium and
      Luxembourg. Through its wholly owned subsidiary Alpha Card Merchant Services
      S.C.R.L./C.V.B.A. (‘ACMS’) it also provides merchant acquiring services in Belgium
1   OJ L 24, 29.1.2004 p. 1.
Commission européenne, B-1049 Bruxelles / Europese Commissie, B-1049 Brussel - Belgium. Telephone: (32-2) 299 11 11.

     and Luxembourg to merchants who wish to accept payments through American
     Express branded payment cards.
II.  THE OPERATION
5.   Alpha Card/ACMS is an existing joint venture under joint control of American Express
     and Fortis. Alpha Card is not carrying out all the functions of an autonomous economic
     entity and is not therefore considered a full-function joint venture.
6.   American Express and Fortis have agreed to change the underlying agreements of
     Alpha Card and to grant it greater autonomy. Due to these changes Alpha Card would
     become a full-function joint venture.
7.   Accordingly, the transaction is notifiable under Article 3(4) of the Merger Regulation
     and paragraph 109 of the Jurisdictional Notice2.
     Full functionality
8.   Alpha Card is a joint venture licensed by American Express to operate a payment card
     issuing business and a merchant acquiring business for American Express branded
     cards.
9.   The joint venture operates from facilities which are separate from those of its parent
     companies and it has its own management dedicated to the operation of its business.
     Alpha Card sets up its own annual business plan and is responsible for most of its
     investment decisions in order to expand its issuing and acquiring activities. Alpha Card
     does not act as a mere agent of American Express, but is a named “issuer” (carries out
     all sales, marketing and operational activities, in particular sets prices, credit and
     financial criteria, decides which cards to issue, enters into contractual arrangements
     with cardholders) pursuant to its license agreement with American Express.
10. In Belgium and Luxembourg the cards issued by Alpha Card are distributed through
     Fortis […]. Alpha Card is operating on the market on a lasting basis.
11.   In the same way Alpha Card, via its subsidiary ACMS, acts as an “acquirer” in its
     contracts with merchants (signs up the merchants, sets merchant discount rate, sets
     credit and financial criteria, manages receivables) pursuant to its license agreement
     with American Express.
12. Currently Alpha Card outsources certain processing services, […] to American
     Express. Although Alpha Card has the possibility to obtain the necessary processing
     services from a third party, this option requires the express consent of American
     Express and is subject to a veto by American Express at the meetings of the board of
     directors of Alpha Card.
13. Therefore, in the past Alpha Card did not operate as a full function joint venture within
     the meaning of Article 3(4) of the Merger Regulation. However, as a result of the
     present transaction, i.e. the change of certain Alpha Card's corporate governance and
2   Commission Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 on the
    control of concentrations between undertakings of 10 July 2007.
                                                         2

     contractual provisions3, Alpha Card will acquire autonomy to select an independent
     provider of the processing services that are currently provided by American Express.
14. According to the Amended and Restated Card Operator Agreement and the Merchant
     Acquirer Agreement the requirement to obtain the prior written consent of American
     Express before outsourcing card processing functions would be removed. The
     Shareholders Agreement would be amended to delegate to the General Manager of
     Alpha Card the power to terminate the services agreements with American Express and
     appoint an alternative provider […]. The Amended and Restated Financial Services
     Agreement and the Merchant Acquirer Agreement would also be amended to permit
     Alpha Card and ACMS to terminate the agreementson […] notice. […].
15. On the basis of the above it has to be concluded that American Express would no
     longer be able to veto a decision on selecting an independent processing services
     provider. Alpha Card would be able to exercise full autonomy in its choice of third
     party service provider and it would gain further independence from its parent company.
     This would result in Alpha Card being a full function joint venture.
     Joint control
16. According to the Amended and Restated Shareholders Agreement American Express
     and Fortis each hold 50 % of the voting shares of Alpha Card. Board resolutions are
     made on the basis of a majority vote. Each ofAmerican Express and Fortis appoint four
     of eight directors in the board of directors of Alpha Card. A quorum for a meeting is
     […] directors, […] from each of American Express and Fortis.
17. The board of ACMS comprises […] directors,[…] and requires […]for board
     resolutions (with a quorum of […] directors) […]. In the event of deadlock at the board
     level that cannot be resolved at the level of senior executives or through mediation,
     […].
18. The notifying parties confirmed that the ownership structure would remain unchanged
     post transaction.
19. Based on the above, the notified operation leads to the acquisition of joint control and
     constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger
     Regulation.
III. CONCENTRATION
20. As a result of the notified transaction involving restructuring of the Alpha Card joint
     venture, the notifying parties would acquire joint control over the full-function joint
     venture. The proposed transaction therefore constitutes a concentration within the
     meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
3   Pursuant to the transaction the following agreements will be amended: the Amended and Restated Card
    Operator Agreement, the Merchant Acquirer Agreement, the Shareholders Agreement, the Amended and
    Restated Financial Services Agreement and the Merchant Acquirer Financial Services Agreement.
                                                        3

IV. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
21. The operation has a Community dimension pursuant to Article 1(2) of the Merger
     Regulation. The parties have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover in excess of
     EUR 5,000 million (American Express EUR 20,234 million, Fortis EUR 120,457
     million, Alpha Card EUR […] million), and two of them have a Community-wide
     turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (American Express EUR […] million, Fortis
     EUR […] million). Each of the undertakings does not achieve more than two-thirds of
     its Community-wide turnover in one and the same Member State.
22. The transaction thus has a Community dimension within the meaning of Article 1(2) of
     the Merger Regulation.
V.   RELEVANT MARKETS
23. In the previous decisions4 the Commission has defined the payment card issuing
     market as being separate from the merchant acquiring market. The proposed
     transaction concerns the markets for payment card issuing, and its possible sub-
     segments, and merchant acquiring in Belgium and Luxembourg.
Payment Card Issuing
24. In previous decisions5 the Commission ultimately left open whether the market for
     payment card issuing should be further sub-divided. The Commission considered in
     those decisions that payment card issuing could possibly be split into the following
     markets:
        - cards issued to households and cards issued to commercial customers6;
        - international7 and national cards;
        - debit8 and credit cards;
4  See Commission decisions of 3 October 2007 in Case COMP/M.4844 Fortis/ABN AMRO Assets, 2 June
   2005 in Case M.3740 Barclays Bank/Foreningssparbanken/JV, para. 11. In the context of antitrust
   proceeding see Commission decision of 19 December 2007 in Cases COMP/34.579 MasterCard,
   COMP/36.518 EuroCommerce and COMP/38.580 Commercial Cards.
5  See COMP/M.4844 Fortis/ABN AMRO Assets, cited above, at para.48, Commission decisions of 29
   September 2006 in Case COMP/M.4316 Atos Origin/Banksys/BCC, para. 22-23, 18 October 2005 in
   Case COMP/M.3894 Unicredito/HVB, para. 13, and of 8 November 2001 in Case Nordbanken/Postgirot,
   para.15-16 and following.
6  The cards issued to commercial customers consist of the cards issued to SMEs and large corporate
   customers.
7  Cards that belong to international network and/or carry international acceptance trademark such as
   MasterCard/Maestro, Visa/Electron, American Express or Diners and can be used at POS and ATMs
   internationally. National cards can only be used within one country whereas international cards may be
   used in several countries.
                                                       4

         - selective and general cards.9
25. In addition, the previous cases may also suggest the possibility of alternative market
      segmentation in respect of intra-brand competition, where the issuing market would
      comprise issuing cards of a particular brand only.10
26. The Commission has previously defined the market of payment card issuing as being
      likely national in scope11, although it has also recognized the possibility of widening
      the market in the future. The notifying Parties followed this approach and provided
      data based on national geographic markets.
27. For the purposes of the present case the exact product and geographical market
      definitions can be left open since the proposed transaction does not raise serious
      competition concerns in the narrowest market definition.
Merchant Acquiring
28.    In a similar vein in the previous case practice12 it has been indicated that the merchant
      acquiring market may further be subdivided according to the type of scheme
      organisation (international / domestic), customer type (consumer/commercial), type of
      card (debit/credit) or according to the brand (American Express Personal Green
      Card/Personal Gold Card/Personal Platinum Card/Corporate Card/Visa/Visa
      electron/V pay/MasterCard/Maestro etc.).
29. The previous cases also suggest the possibility of alternative market segmentation in
      respect of intra-brand competition, where the acquiring market would comprise
      acquiring of merchants for a particular brand of cards.13
8   The only distinguishing feature of credit/charge cards vis-à-vis debit cards is that the former allows the
    cardholder to defer payments. Store cards are marketed via retailers to help to finance specific purchases
    and although they may have revolving credit functionality they are typically used by consumers only to
    fund the original transaction.
9   General cards can be used at all points of sales that accept cards belonging to the system as a method of
    payment and to make withdrawals from automatic teller machines. Selective cards however can only be
    used with certain merchants.
10  In antitrust context see the Commission decision of 17 October 2007 in case COMP/38606 Groupement
    des Cartes Bancaires. A similar approach in the context of merchant card acquiring has been taken in the
    Commission decisions of 19 December 2007 in Cases COMP/34.579 MasterCard,
    COMP/36.518 EuroCommerce and COMP/38.580 Commercial Cards (the "MasterCard decision") and 3
    October 2007 in case COMP/37860 Morgan Stanley/Visa International and Visa Europe.
11  See cases COMP/M.2567 Nordbanken/Postgirot, COM/M.3740 Barclays Bank/Foreningssparbanken/JV,
    and COMP/M.4844 Fortis/ABN AMRO Assets.
12  See cases COMP/M.4316 Atos Origin / Banksys / BCC, paras. 21-23, COMP/M.2567
    NordBanken/Postgirot,         para.18      Commission       investigation  in     Case     COMP/M.2390
    SEB/Föreningssparbanken (the case was closed before a formal decision was taken due to the withdrawal
    of the merger notification). In context of antitrust proceedings the Commission has recently identified a
    market for merchant acquiring in the MasterCard decision (id. footnote 9), but it was stated that further
    subdivision of the market can be left open.
13  In antitrust context see, inter alia, the "MasterCard decision"
                                                            5

30. In line with previous Commission decisions14 the notifying Parties provided data based
     on national geographic markets, although the Commission has acknowledged the
     possibility of widening the market in the future.
31. For the purposes of the present case the questions on whether the merchant acquiring
     market should be further segmented and what is its exact geographic market definition
     can be left open, since the proposed transaction does not raise serious doubts as to the
     existence of a significant impediment of effective competition on any of the alternative
     markets.
 VI. COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
     Horizontal effects in payment card issuing
32. The activities of the Parties overlap in the overall payment card issuing market and in
     its potential segments, i.e. segment for credit card issuing, segment for card issuing to
     commercial customers and segment for card issuing to consumers. In essence, by
     having joint control over Alpha Card, Fortis, which is active in the issuing of other
     debit and credit cards in Belgium and Luxembourg, will also have a decisive influence
     on the issuing of American Express credit cards in those Member States.
33. If the overall payment card issuing market definition is to be considered, Alpha Card,
     American Express and Fortis are active in this market in Belgium and in Luxembourg.
     The combined market share of the Parties in Belgium is [40-50] %% (Fortis [40-50] %,
     Alpha Card [0-5%] and American Express [0-5] %). The combined market share in
     Luxembourg is [30-40] % (Fortis [30-40] %, Alpha Card [0-5] %, American Express
     [0-5] %).
34. The market share increment "added" by the transaction to the market share of Fortis in
     the market for payment card issuing is small on both national markets (Belgium: [0-5]
     % and Luxembourg: [0-5] %). Furthermore, there is a number of payment card issuers
     active both in Belgium (Dexia: [20-30] %, KBC Bank: [10-20] % and ING Groep: [10-
     20] %) and in Luxembourg (Banque and Caisse d'Epargne pour Etat: [30-40] %, Dexia:
     [20-30] %, ING Groep: [5-10] %).
35. Considering the possible segments of payment card issuing as indicated above, the
     only relevant overlaps between the parties would occur in the segment of credit card
     issuing, and in particular in credit card issuing for commercial and consumer cards.
36. Alpha Card and American Express issue only American Express cards that are general
     international credit cards for consumers and commercial customers, whereas Fortis
     issues both credit and debit general international cards for consumers and commercial
     customers.15 Therefore there is no overlap between Alpha Card and the Parent
     companies in the segments of national cards, debit cards and selective cards.
14  See cases COMP/M.2567 Nordbanken/Postgirot, COM/M.3740 Barclays Bank/Föreningssparbanken/JV,
    and COMP/M.4844 Fortis/ABN AMRO Assets. In the context of antitrust proceeding see the MasterCard
    decision (id. footnote 9).
15  Fortis issues Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, Bancontact/Proton, the latter being co-branded with the Visa or
    MasterCard international schemes.
                                                        6

37. In the possible segment of credit card issuing the market share of the Parties in
    Belgium is [40-50] % (Fortis [30-40] %, Alpha Card [5-10] % and American Express
    [0-5] %).
38. Considering that both American Express and Alpha Card are only active in the
    segment of credit card issuing, the narrower segment where the overlap between the
    Parties could occur would be the segments of credit cards issued to commercial
    customers and credit cards issued to consumers.
39. If the market would be sub-divided into further sub-segments, in the segment of
    payment card issuing to commercial customers the Parties would have combined
    market share of [40-50] % (Fortis [30-40] %, Alpha Card [5-10] %, American Express
    [0-5] %) in Belgium, whereas in the segment of payment card issuing to consumers the
    market share of the Parties in Belgium would be [40-50] % (Fortis [30-40] %, Alpha
    Card [10-20] %, American Express [0-5] %). Concerning the market shares for all
    relevant segments, the Parties confirmed that their market shares in Luxembourg do
    not differ significantly from their market shares in Belgium. This approach has been
    also reflected in the overall market shares on the payment card issuing market in
    Luxembourg.
40. In any event, Alpha Card has been active already in the past in the issuing of American
    Express cards under joint control of Fortis and American Express as the present
    transaction is notifiable under the Merger Regulation only since Alpha Card will
    become a full-function joint venture. The present transaction will not change the
    incentives of Fortis in relation to the issuing of other (credit) cards itself or of
    American Express cards by Alpha Card. Therefore, the transaction does not constitute
    a significant change in the market compared to the past.
41. Furthermore, in the course of market investigation the majority of respondents did not
    raise any competition concerns with regard to the transaction, namely no increase in
    fees or product availability has been foreseen. A number of respondents stated that the
    impact of the transaction on the payment card issuing market in Belgium and in
    Luxembourg would be limited due to a small market share of American Express in the
    above mentioned markets.
42. Even in case of hypothetical market segmentation for cards of the American Express
    brand, where Alpha Card and American Express are already issuing American Express
    branded cards (American Express has retained its issuing business only for cards in
    respect of certain multi-national accounts, whereas it has transferred the majority of its
    business in Belgium and Luxembourg to Alpha Card), the transaction would not have
    impact in the alternative segment of the market, as Fortis is not active in issuing
    American Express branded cards.
    Horizontal effects in merchant acquiring
43. The activities of the Parties (American Express and Alpha Card) could only overlap in
    respect of merchant acquiring for the American Express cards. Fortis itself does not
    carry out any acquiring activities in Luxembourg and Belgium.
44. The Parties have provided the market shares for the overall merchant acquiring
    markets in Belgium and Luxembourg. Any possibly overlapping activities in this field
    would come from acquiring for American Express cards as American Express has
    retained its acquiring business only for cards in respect of certain multi-national
                                                7

     accounts, whereas it has transferred the majority of its business in Belgium and
     Luxembourg to Alpha Card. The combined market shares of the Parties are very low:
     in Belgium [0-5] % (Alpha Card [0-5] % and American Express [0-5] %) and in
     Luxembourg around [0-10] % (Alpha Card: [0-5] % and American Express: [0-5] %).
     Furthermore, there is a number of very large competitors active on the markets: Atos
     Worldline ([80-90] %) and Elavon ([10-20] %) in Belgium and CETREL ([80-90] %)
     in Luxembourg.
45. Also on any other delineation of the market the transaction does not raise competition
     concerns as combined market shares are low and Fortis is anyhow not active on any of
     those possible markets. Furthermore, even in case of hypothetical market segmentation
     for cards of the American Express brand, where Alpha Card and American Express are
     already acquiring merchants for American Express branded cards, the transaction
     would not have impact in the alternative segment of the market, as Fortis is not active
     in acquiring for American Express branded cards (and neither for any other cards in
     Belgium and Luxembourg).
46. In the course of market investigation, none of the competitors of the Parties identified
     any competitive concerns related to the transaction in both markets for payment card
     issuing and for merchant acquiring. The respondents found that the notified transaction
     is not likely to give rise to any competitive concerns due to the fact that it only
     constitutes a restructuring of Alpha Card and the current market shares of American
     Express in Belgium and in Luxembourg remain low.
47. In view of the above, the proposed transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its
     compatibility with the common market.
VII. CONCLUSION
48. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
     operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
     Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
     Regulation (EC) No 139/2004.
