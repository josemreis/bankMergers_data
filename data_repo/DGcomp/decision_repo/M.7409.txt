1.      On 09 October 2014, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
        pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 by which investment funds
        managed by affiliates of Apollo Management L.P. (“Apollo”, United States), acquire within
        the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation sole control of Companhia de
        Seguros Tranquilidade, S.A. and its affiliates (the “Tranquilidade Group”, Portugal), by way
                                  2
        of purchase of shares.

        Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the replacement of

2. The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
   <U+F02D>    affiliates of Apollo invest in companies and debt issued by companies involved in
        various businesses throughout the world. Examples of current investments include, inter
        alia, companies in the chemical, cruise line, logistics, paper, and metals businesses;
   <U+F02D>    the Tranquilidade Group provides insurance products and services, both in the life and
        non-life insurance segments. The company is based in Lisbon, Portugal and it operates
        mainly in Portugal.
3. After examination of the notification, the European Commission has concluded that the
   notified operation falls within the scope of the Merger Regulation and of paragraph 5(c) of
   the Commission Notice on a simplified procedure for treatment of certain concentrations
   under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004.3
4. For the reasons set out in the Notice on a simplified procedure, the European Commission
   has decided not to oppose the notified operation and to declare it compatible with the
   internal market and with the EEA Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of
   Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
5. The acquisition of the Tranquilidade Group by Apollo has no impact, and therefore bears
   no prejudice to, the on-going State Aid procedure regarding the resolution measures
   applied to BES and the creation and capitalisation of Novo Banco.
