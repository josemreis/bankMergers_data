                                         COMMISSION DECISION
                                                   of 29.3.2017
         declaring a concentration to be incompatible with the internal market and the
       functioning of the EEA Agreement (Case M.7995– Deutsche Börse / London Stock

   THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
   Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 57
   thereof,
   Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January.2004 on the control of
   concentrations between undertakings1, and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
   Having regard to the Commission's decision of 28 September 2016 to initiate proceedings in this
   case,
   Having given the undertakings concerned the opportunity to make known their views on the
   objections raised by the Commission,
   Having regard to the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Concentrations2,
   Having regard to the final report of the Hearing Officer in this case 3,
   Whereas:
   (1)        On 24 August 2016, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
              concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (the "Merger
              Regulation") by which the two previously independent undertakings Deutsche Börse
              AG (Germany, "DBAG") and London Stock Exchange Group plc (United Kingdom,
              "LSEG") would merge within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a) of the Merger
              Regulation (the "Transaction"). LSEG and DBAG are hereinafter referred to as the
              "Notifying Parties".
   1.         THE NOTIFYING PARTIES AND THE TRANSACTION
   (2)        DBAG is a diversified financial market infrastructure organisation, best known for
              operating the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse or "FWB"), a
              regulated marketplace for trading stocks, bonds and various other financial
              instruments. It also operates other regulated exchanges, most notably Eurex and the
              European Energy Exchange ("EEX") trading various types of derivative products.
   1
            OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ("the Merger Regulation"). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on
            the Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the
            replacement of "Community" by "Union" and "common market" by "internal market". The terminology
            of the TFEU will be used throughout this decision ("Decision").

       Apart from trading, its activities include the supply of post-trade infrastructure
       services such as clearing, settlement and custody services, as well as market data,
       indices and other information products.
   (3) LSEG is also one of Europe's pre-eminent financial infrastructure companies, best
       known for operating the London Stock Exchange. It also owns Borsa Italiana, the
       Italian stock exchange and operates a number of other trading platforms trading in
       stocks, other equity-like exchange traded products, bonds, and derivatives. LSEG is
       also active in the post-trading space, most notably in clearing through the London
       Clearing House ("LCH.Clearnet") and Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia
       ("CC&G"), the Italian clearing house. LCH.Clearnet also operates the clearing
       service SwapClear for clearing of over-the-counter ("OTC") traded derivatives.
       LSEG also offers indices, data and other information products, and is also active in
       settlement and custody services.
   (4) The Transaction would be implemented via the establishment of a newly
       incorporated holding company, which would acquire both LSEG and DBAG with the
       two operations taking place at the same time and being conditional upon each other.
       It follows that the Transaction constitutes a concentration within the meaning of
       Article 3(1)(a) of the Merger Regulation.
   2.  UNION DIMENSION
   (5) The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of
       more than EUR 5 000 million (DBAG: [BUSINESS SECRETS]; LSEG:
       [BUSINESS SECRETS]). Each of them has an EU-wide turnover in excess of EUR
       250 million (DBAG: [BUSINESS SECRETS]; LSEG: [BUSINESS SECRETS]), but
       neither achieves more than two-thirds of its aggregate Union-wide turnover within
       one and the same Member State.
   (6) The Transaction has therefore a Union dimension pursuant to Article 1(2) of the
       Merger Regulation.
   3.  PROCEDURE
   (7) After a preliminary examination of the notification and following the first phase
       market investigation (the "Phase I market investigation"), the Commission concluded
       that the Transaction raised serious doubts as to the compatibility with the internal
       market and adopted a decision to initiate proceedings pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) of
       the Merger Regulation on 28 September 2016 (the "Decision opening the
       proceedings"). The Notifying Parties submitted written comments on the Decision
       opening the proceedings (the "Notifying Parties' response to the Decision opening
       the proceedings"), which culminated in the submission of a consolidated version of
       the Notifying Parties' response to the Decision opening the proceedings on 9
       November 2016. Additional submissions were received on 20 November 2016.
   (8) Following the in-depth market investigation (the "Phase II market investigation")
       which supplemented the findings of the Phase I Market Investigation (jointly referred
       to as the "market investigation"), the Commission addressed a Statement of
       Objections (the "Statement of Objections") to the Notifying Parties on 14 December
       2016. The Notifying Parties responded to the Statement of Objections (the "Response
       to the Statement of Objections") in a preliminary response on 6 January 2017 and a
       full response on 13 January 2017. On 24 January 2017, the Notifying Parties
EN                                          10                                               EN

        submitted a supplementary response. A formal State of Play meeting took place on
        the same day.
   (9)  On 9 January 2017, the Notifying Parties informed the Commission that they did not
        wish to develop their arguments in an Oral Hearing.
   (10) On 19 October 2016, the Notifying Parties requested an extension of 15 working
        days under the second subparagraph of Article 10(3) of the Merger Regulation. The
        time limits of the Commission's review were extended accordingly. On 14 December
        2016, the Notifying Parties requested a further extension of five working days
        pursuant to the third sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 10(3) of the
        Merger Regulation. By decision of 16 December 2016, the Commission granted the
        requested additional extension.
   (11) On 26 January 2017, the Commission issued a letter of facts (the "Letter of Facts").
        The Notifying Parties submitted their comments on the Letter of Facts on 30 January
        2017 (the "Notifying Parties' reply to the Letter of Facts").
   (12) On 6 February 2017, the Notifying Parties submitted commitments (the
        "Commitments") pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 8(2) of the Merger
        Regulation. Consequently, the period for the adoption of a final decision was
        extended by 15 working days pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 10(3) of
        the Merger Regulation.
   (13) The Commission launched the market test (the "Market Test") of the Commitments
        on 9 February 2017.
   (14) On 27 February 2017 the Notifying Parties submitted modified Commitments.
   (15) The meeting of the Advisory Committee took place on 13 March 2017. The
        Advisory Committee issued a positive opinion on the draft decision.
   (16) The Hearing Officer issued his final report on 15 March 2017.
   4.   MARKET INVESTIGATION
   (17) The Commission conducted far-reaching Phase I and Phase II market investigations,
        which included sending questionnaires to a variety of market participants, conducting
        teleconference interviews and meetings with market participants, and analysing a
        substantial amount of information received from the Notifying Parties including
        internal documents.
   (18) Specifically, the Phase I market investigation, besides the analysis of information
        submitted by the Notifying Parties in the Form CO and in various additional
        submissions, included evidence collected through telephone interviews and meetings
        with close to 30 key market participants, including customers and competitors of the
        Notifying Parties, regulatory bodies and industry associations. In addition, 10
        different questionnaires were sent to different groups of market participants (770 in
        total, of which 354 were answered).
   (19) In addition, during the Phase II market investigation, besides collecting and
        analysing the information received from the Notifying Parties including internal
        documents, the Commission sent seven different questionnaires to different groups of
        market participants (651 in total). Moreover, the Commission sent tailor-made
        requests for information ("RFIs") to a number of third parties, including Bats Europe,
        Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME"), Euroclear, Euronext, Intercontinental
EN                                            11                                               EN

         Exchange ("ICE"), Nasdaq and Singapore Exchange ("SGX"). A number of these
         tailor-made RFIs included requests for internal documents. The Phase II market
         investigation also included additional telephone interviews and meetings with close
         to 15 key market participants, including customers and competitors of the Notifying
         Parties and industry associations.
   (20)  Throughout the procedure, the Commission also received substantiated submissions
         from a number of market participants, specifically EuroCCP, Euroclear, Euronext,
         ICE, BME, Nasdaq as well as a number of financial associations (including Paris
         Europlace, the European Investors' Association and the Investment Association).
         Some of these submissions also included analyses prepared by economic consultants.
   (21)  The Commission also notes that, throughout the procedure, a number of market
         participants declined to answer to a significant number of the Commission's
         questions due to their direct or indirect involvement in the preparation of the
         Transaction.4
   5.    BACKGROUND TO THE ASSESSMENT                              OF     MERGERS         IN    THE
         FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS
   (22)  The assessment of mergers between operators of financial markets infrastructures
         needs to be performed against a background of the specific features of these markets.
         First, these markets are characterised by a two-sided "matrix" structure (Section 5.1.
         below). Second, specific features in this market, in particular the existence of strong
         network effects and economies of scale and scope, have implications on the ease of
         market entry and the regulatory framework (Section 5.2. below).
   5.1.  The two dimensions of the financial infrastructure markets matrix
   (23)  The Commission's competitive assessment of the Transaction is based on the matrix
         structure of the financial infrastructure markets, but focuses on one of two principal
         dimensions: the different types of financial instruments or asset classes.
   (24)  While for each financial instrument a number of specific services (or the bundles
         thereof) of the financial instruments value chain (namely listing, trading, clearing and
         settlement) may be required, and there are commonalities along the value chain from
         a supply-side perspective, demand is heavily focused on specific types of financial
         instruments (for example the trading and clearing of an interest rate derivative).
   (25)  Figure 1 below illustrates the two dimensions of the matrix structure setting out the
         legal entities through which DBAG and LSEG are active in the relevant services and
         product markets.
   4
        These companies include, among others, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Barclays, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank,
        HSBC.

   Figure 1: Notifying Parties' activities in various product classes along the value chain.
   Source: Commission's computation based on information from the Notifying Parties.
   (26)      The complementary services offered by financial markets infrastructure providers
             can either be obtained as an integrated service from one provider or can be combined
             from different providers. Historically, DBAG has been active throughout the value
             chain and operates a fully integrated "closed vertical silo" model meaning that, in
             most instances, it does not allow customers to mix-and-match services it provides
             with services from competing providers.5 LSEG, by contrast, covers the value chain
             for executing a financial transaction more selectively (for example in derivatives it is
             predominantly strong in clearing and more generally it is not vertically integrated
             into settlement, except for its Italian business through Monte Titoli). As a result,
             LSEG has historically operated a model that can generally be considered as an "open
             model" whereby its commercial strategy allows the creation of products that combine
             services from different providers. In practice, this involves, on the one hand,
             combining its trading services with services from third parties (for example,
             settlement services provided by Euroclear for trades executed on LSE), and on the
             other hand, it involves providing its own services to customers of third parties (for
             example, clearing services provided by LCH.Clearnet for trades executed on
             Euronext).6
   (27)      In view of the foregoing, the Decision is structured principally according to groups
             of different financial instruments. The second dimension of the matrix is to be borne
             in mind however, as customers often purchase "composite" products or services
             when trading a specific financial instrument. The Commission will take this into
             account in its assessment of the Transaction and the different sets of commitments
             submitted by the Notifying Parties.
   5
           As will be discussed in the respective sections on product markets, there are rare exceptions where
           DBAG does permit customers to use services from third parties. For example, DBAG's subsidiary
           Clearstream is not entirely closed to external providers, but offers a bridge to Euroclear. [BUSINESS

   5.1.1. Introduction to the categories of financial instruments in the matrix
   (28)   The financial instruments relevant for the assessment of the Transaction can be
          grouped into three broad categories, namely cash instruments, repurchasing
          agreements ("repos") and derivatives.
   (29)   Cash instruments are transferable securities that are sold and delivered against a
          payment in cash. Cash instruments fall into two broad categories, equities and fixed
          income instruments. Equities are securities that provide the holder with ownership in
          a company, either directly (for example a share of company stock) or indirectly,
          through the ownership of a share in an investment vehicle that holds the stocks.
          Fixed income cash instruments are securities that give the right to a predefined
          stream of cash-flows. The most common fixed income instrument is a bond, i.e. a
          securitised and tradable loan issued by corporations or governments.
   (30)   Repurchasing agreements or "repos" are contracts between two counterparties that
          stipulate the selling and re-purchasing of a specific asset (usually bonds) at a future
          date. They function either as short term cash loans in which securities are used as
          collateral or short term borrowings of securities in which cash is used as collateral. A
          large part of repos have maturities of less than a month and overnight repos are also
          common.
   (31)   Derivatives are financial products designed to transfer various types of economic risk
          between trading parties. The risk transferred can be the change in the price of an
          asset, a basket of assets, the value of a financial indicator, the level of interest rates or
          any other variable. The price of a derivative depends on the changes in the value of
          the underlying variable, for example the price of certain assets specified in the
          product. Such products therefore derive their value (hence the word "derivative")
          from the underlying variable. Derivatives typically take the form of a contract,
          although certain derivatives are structured as a security.
   5.1.2. Introduction to the services along the value chain in the matrix
   (32)   With respect to the financial instruments value chain, listing in the narrow sense
          refers to the practice of admitting a particular security to trading on exchanges or
          similar trading venues such as a Multilateral Trading Facility ("MTF") at the request
          of the issuer in the context of raising capital and thus enabling the security to be
          publicly traded. Listing in this sense is connected to the raising of capital by the
          issuer of the security and as such is only applicable to cash instruments. Listing in
          the wider sense refers to making a product available for trading on an exchange or
          similar venue and in this sense a derivative product can also be listed. Since listing in
          this wider sense is not relevant for issuers and just a technicality of a trading venue,
          this meaning is less relevant for the purposes of the competitive assessment.
          Accordingly, for the purposes of the Decision, the term listing will be used in the
          narrower meaning and consequently is only applicable to cash instruments.
   (33)   Trading is the expression of a mutual commitment by two parties to enter into a
          transaction involving financial instruments, i.e. entering into an agreement to buy or
          sell cash securities, entering into a repo or a derivatives contract. The trading
          environment can vary greatly depending on the instrument in question and the
          applicable regulation. At one end of the spectrum, trading can occur on regulated
          exchanges or on MTFs in full transparency and on a multilateral basis, i.e. with
          multiple buying and selling interests interacting on the platform. At the other end the
          transaction can be negotiated privately and bilaterally without transparency, which is
EN                                                14                                                    EN

          referred to as over-the-counter ("OTC") trading. There are a number of trading
          methods that are in between these two extremes of the spectrum and which may or
          may not be classified as either exchange or OTC trading.
   (34)   Clearing refers to all activities in the trading cycle between the commitment to enter
          into a transaction (trade execution) and the fulfilment of that commitment
          (settlement). The main function of clearing is to ensure that the obligations resulting
          from the trade are honoured by the transacting parties. In other words the role of
          clearing is to manage counterparty risk, i.e. the risk that one of the parties defaults on
          its commitment. If the clearing service is performed by a neutral third party, this
          third party is referred to as a central counterparty ("CCP") or clearing house and the
          activity is referred to as central clearing. In central clearing, once a trade has been
          executed by two counterparties, the trade can be handed over to a clearing house,
          which steps between the two original counterparties and assumes the legal
          counterparty risk for the trade. This implies that one trade between two parties - "A"
          and "B" - is split into two separate transactions: one between "A" and the central
          counterparty and a second between the central counterparty and "B". This process of
          transferring the trade title to the clearing house is referred to as "novation".
   (35)   In order to manage the risk taken over by the CCP, specific provisions exist between
          the central counterparties and its members including contributions to default funds as
          well as specific collateral requirements for individual transactions, called "margin".7
          These margin requirements can be very significant in size and are important factors
          for the selection of a clearing venue.
   (36)   In addition to their principal function of managing counterparty risk, CCPs often also
          perform other activities such as the registration and verification of the trade and of its
          counterparties and the transmission of the details of the trade to the relevant
          settlement body. As the Notifying Parties are infrastructure providers, their activity
          in the clearing field is always central clearing. Bilateral clearing is performed by the
          counterparties trading an instrument directly among themselves.
   (37)   Settlement is the final stage of the trading life cycle in which a security traded by a
          seller is delivered to the purchaser in exchange for payment. Settlement therefore
          fulfils the contractual obligations of the buyer and the seller respectively in relation
          to a trade. This service is provided by the relevant national or International Central
          Securities Depositaries ("CSDs" or "ICSDs", respectively) or, in some cases, by
          intermediaries (such as custodians).
   (38)   Settlement services are often provided together with custody services, which refer to
          safe-keeping services such as the maintenance of securities' accounts on behalf of
          investors and the processing of corporate actions like dividend and interest payments
          or voting rights in the case of shares.
   (39)   Collateral management consists in managing and optimising the use of securities or
          other assets provided as collateral in different types of transactions (in particular,
          repo transactions, securities lending, and derivative transactions).
   7
        There are two types of margin: initial margin depending on the potential loss a contract or portfolio of a
        clearing member could incur based on a risk model, and variation margin to cover fluctuations in the
        market affecting the potential loss, and possibly requiring the posting of additional margin.

   5.1.2.1. Service layer competition versus bundle-to-bundle competition
   (40)      The Commission notes that executing a trade of a financial instrument requires
             customers to obtain a number of complementary services from market infrastructure
             providers (in particular trading, clearing, settlement, custody and, under certain
             circumstances, collateral management). Where a concrete product inevitably implies
             the purchase of at least two complementary services (for instance trading and
             clearing of exchange-traded derivatives) and customers are limited in their choices of
             these complementary services, the Commission considers that exchanges compete in
             offering bundles of services (or integrated services).
   (41)      In situations where the counterparties to a financial transaction demand the full
             composite product and not only individual service components, competition takes
             place between the available bundles of services. Assessing the competitive
             implications of a merger requires in such a case evaluating the impact of a
             transaction on the bundle (and not merely on a component-by-component basis).
   (42)      The most evident example for bundle-to-bundle competition is exchange-traded
             derivatives ("ETDs"): when trading on exchange, customers must in general also buy
             the complementary clearing service.8 Furthermore, when the Markets in Financial
             Instruments Directive "MIFID II" and the Markets in Financial Instruments
             Regulation ("MIFIR")9 starts to apply, trading venue operators will be legally
             required to ensure that ETDs are cleared by a CCP.10 Therefore, exchanges compete
             in the provision of service bundles combining both the trading and clearing of ETDs.
             In its decision DBAG/NYSE Euronext11, the Commission noted with regard to
             derivatives that, while, in theory, trading and clearing could potentially be provided
             as separate services, many exchanges at present generally provide users with an
             integrated service including the trading and clearing of derivative contracts and for
             which they may charge a single fee.
   (43)      For OTC traded derivatives on the other hand, the situation is different. There is a
             multitude of options for customers on where and how to trade. Depending on their
             choice of trade executions, customers also have options on where and in some cases
             even whether, to clear. In this situation, the Commission considers it more
             appropriate to assess competition on each service layer separately, for example to
             analyse separate trading and clearing markets for OTC traded derivatives. Similarly,
             when, as in bonds, there is neither an obligation to clear, nor a market structure or
   8
           Indeed, many derivatives exchanges (such as Eurex, CME, ICE, etc.) are vertically integrated into
           clearing by operating clearing houses for clearing of instruments traded on their venues. Other
           exchanges, while not being strictly speaking vertically integrated into clearing, offer clearing services
           for contracts executed on their platforms through agreements with third-party clearing houses that they
           select, generally on an exclusive basis. In such a scenario, customers also purchase an integrated service
           from the trading venue and have ultimately no choice of clearing service provider.

             practice that entails that clearing is inherently linked to trading,12 the Commission
             will assess the individual service layers.
   (44)      There are also financial instruments where it cannot be clearly delineated whether
             they are characterised by service level or bundle-to-bundle competition. For example
             for ATS traded non-triparty repos, there are, as discussed in Section 7.2.2.4. and
             Section 7.2.2.5., a number of compelling arguments that indicate that competition
             takes place between bundles even though, contrary to ETDs, there is no legal
             obligation to clear, and that there exists on a limited (for practical purposes,
             extremely limited) degree of optionality for customers to mix-and-match trading and
             clearing service providers.
   5.1.2.2. Bundle-to-bundle competition can potentially lead to horizontal effects even if the
             Notifying Parties do not control all service components
   (45)      The Transaction involves a combination of DBAG (through Eurex Clearing) and
             LSEG (through LCH.Clearnet primarily13), which together make up [80-90%] of all
             clearing of derivatives in Europe, and [90-100%] of all repo and bond clearing.
             Nonetheless, the Notifying Parties argue that Eurex Clearing and LCH.Clearnet are
             not in competition with each other and that the Transaction cannot, therefore, create
             anticompetitive horizontal effects. The reason, according to the Notifying Parties,
             why Eurex Clearing and LCH.Clearnet would not be in competition with each other,
             is that, unlike LCH.Clearnet, Eurex does not provide merchant clearing services to
             third parties. Since Eurex does not offer services to the same customers (in the
             Notifying Parties' view), there would be no horizontal competition that could be
             restricted.
   (46)      From an economic perspective, this view of competition disregards the fact that
             competition in ETD derivatives and certain repos takes place through integrated
             bundles of services (bundle-to-bundle competition).
   (47)      In order to illustrate the mechanics of competition between service bundles where the
             component services can be supplied by different firms one can consider the
             following example. Assume that customers can choose between two bundles of
             trading and clearing services:
             <U+F0B7>      Firm 1 offers an integrated bundle that consists of its own clearing and trading
                    services (C1 and T1)
             <U+F0B7>      Firm 3 offers a composite bundle consisting of the clearing services of Firm 2
                    (C2) and of its own trading services (T3)
   (48)      Figure 2 illustrates a hypothetical merger between Firm 1 and Firm 2.
   12
           For example, bonds traded on the D2D trading platform of LSEG, MTS Cash, can be either CCP
           cleared or uncleared: [50-60%] of MTS Cash trading volumes are cleared on various CCPs
           (LCH.Clearnet SA, LCH.Clearnet Ltd, CC&G in particular) and [40-50%] are uncleared.

   Figure 2: Pre-merger (left) and post-merger (right) competition between bundles
   Source: Commission's illustration.
   (49)      According to the Notifying Parties' view of financial infrastructure competition, such
             a transaction could not give rise to anticompetitive horizontal effects, because Firm 1
             is not active in the "merchant market" of providing clearing services to third party
             trading venues (such as T3). At most, the Notifying Parties argue, such a situation
             could give rise to foreclosure concerns in the sense that post-merger, C2 might
             hamper access for T3 or engage in a margin squeeze to divert customers to bundle 1.
   (50)      While this potential for vertical effects does exist, it is easy to see, however, that this
             perspective overlooks the main competitive implication of the above transaction.
             After all, the merger not only gives rise to a combination of vertically related
             services (C2 and T1), but also to a combination of horizontally related services (C1
             and C2). As a result it is likely to have substantial horizontal effects by permitting
             the merging parties to monopolise the clearing component of both bundles. As a
             result, the merging parties would be in a position to raise all prices of all offerings
             (including those of separate clearing components and those of integrated
             trading/clearing bundles).
   (51)      The price increases from the horizontal effect would not be intended to divert
             customers away from T3, but rather to increase the combined final price to customers
             and therefore total profits of the combined entity. Therefore, the horizontal effects in
             bundle-to-bundle competition are similar to classical horizontal effects: the cost
             increase of T3 is not undertaken in order to foreclose T3 in the sense of diverting
             customers away from T3 to T1, instead, its purpose is simply to extract consumer
             surplus from the customers of both providers by exploiting the newly won market
             power in clearing. In addition, it is noted that this horizontal merger effect does bring
             about an increase in the clearing costs for the independent trading platform T3.
   (52)      In effect, the transaction in Figure 2 can be studied by first assessing the merger
             between C1 and C2 on clearing prices and in a second step assessing the additional
             vertical effect by comparing foreclosure incentives between the original firm C1+T1
             and the merged firm C1+C2+T1. The first step, the merger of C1 and C2, is a purely
             horizontal merger to (near) monopoly. As such it is likely to generate very
             substantial market power in the provision of clearing services with the associated
             negative effects, in particular increase in the price of clearing services. The second
             step would be to assess the increased foreclosure incentives of the merged firm
             C1+C2+T1 compared to C1+T1. This vertical effect might be small and unclear in its
             direction. The main competitive effect of the transaction can therefore be considered
             as an elimination of horizontal competition.

   5.1.2.3. On top of horizontal effects bundle-to-bundle competition can also lead to vertical
            effects
   (53)     Since product bundles combine complementary products, similarly to vertical
            relationships, they can also lead to vertical effects if the merging parties denied
            clearing access to the independent platform T3 (non-price foreclosure) or if they
            engaged in a margin squeeze in order to divert customers away from T3 to T1 (price-
            based foreclosure). Such non-horizontal conduct, contrary to the horizontal price
            effect described in the previous section (which is primarily exploitative), would
            attempt to shift customers away from the independent platform T3 (and hence is
            primary of an exclusionary nature).
   (54)     As part of its competitive assessment of the Notifying Parties' activities with respect
            to repos and single stock equity derivatives, the Commission assesses whether, on
            the basis of the competitive dynamics on the markets defined in Sections 7.2.2 and
            9.2.4 below, the potential vertical and, in particular, horizontal effects identified
            above would arise as a result of the Transaction, and whether any such effects would
            result in a significant impediment to effective competition within the meaning of
            Article 2 of the Merger Regulation.
   5.2.     Key features of the relevant financial infrastructure markets
   (55)     The various infrastructure markets assessed in the Decision share a number of key
            characteristics which constitute an important background for the assessment of the
            Transaction. These specifically include:
            –      strong network effects and economies of scale and scope translating into
                   specific market structures with incumbency advantage and high barriers to
                   entry,
            –      the existence of a differentiated customer base, which has an impact on the
                   relevance of home bias, the degree of price sensitivity, general trading
                   behaviour and preferences for the execution environment, and
            –      the regulatory framework that shapes the markets at different levels of the
                   value chain by seeking to mitigate network effects and introduce competition
                   between infrastructure providers, and changing the drivers in the industry.
   5.2.1.   Strong network effects and economies of scale and scope at all levels of the value
            chain
   (56)     Financial market infrastructure platforms at all levels of the value chain are
            characterised by significant network effects. Market participants are naturally driven
            to the venues where other market participants are already active. As such market
            participants tend to concentrate their activities on a single venue to achieve
            synergies.14 Therefore, one of the intrinsic qualities of a platform, be it a trading
            venue, a clearing house, or a settlement venue stems from the number of other
            market participants that are concentrating their activities on that specific venue. This
            is because, for instance, in the area of trading, the accumulation of customers implies
            that more people actually trading or at least showing their willingness to do so for a
   14
           [BUSINESS SECRETS]. Thus, "[h]igh order flows are self-sustaining, i.e., attract and retain clients
           and ensure stable market position in the mid-term". DBAG's internal document, "Eurex—Strategy
           compendium", January 2015, page 19 [ID 3750-12574].

          specific price results in a higher likelihood of one participant finding a suitable
          counterparty for a specific trade. This is typically referred to as the "liquidity" of a
          venue15 or the "depth" of the order book.16 Higher liquidity on a platform is typically
          associated with narrower and, therefore, better bid-ask spreads17 which increases the
          likelihood of execution. These characteristics lead to two main consequences. First,
          there are significant first mover benefits in these markets, and second, once liquidity
          has built up on one large venue, this naturally attracts further liquidity. As a result,
          exchanges with less liquidity are more likely to suffer from wider bid-ask spreads
          and lower order book depth.
   (57)   Similarly, in the area of clearing, traders tend to concentrate their clearing in a CCP
          where also other traders clear their trades in the same or correlated instruments.18
          This is because concentration of clearing in one place allows traders to net offsetting
          positions they may have with several counterparties. As a consequence, only the net
          positions at the end of a trading day have to be settled. CCPs can take into account
          correlations between different positions held at the same venue and allow for
          calculation of initial margin based on the total risk within one asset class portfolio
          (portfolio margining) or across portfolios of different asset classes like OTC and
          exchange traded derivatives (cross-margining).19
   (58)   Second, financial platforms are typically characterised by strong economies of scale
          and scope.20 Indeed, a large proportion of the costs of setting up and running
          financial markets infrastructure platforms are independent of the volume of trades
          executed, cleared or settled on the platform. Conversely, the variable costs of trading,
          clearing or settling are typically small, since all instructions are predominantly
          executed digitally through an automated system. As a result, the average cost of
          trading, clearing or settling declines substantially as a platform draws larger amounts
          of liquidity. Moreover, the same infrastructure can be, to a certain extent, used for
          additional products without a proportionate cost increase, leading, again, to a
          reduction of average unit costs for each service.
   (59)   These industry characteristics have two main implications.
   (60)   First, many financial infrastructure markets are characterised by high market shares
          of incumbents and considerable market power in the markets where they enjoy
   15
        Liquidity describes the degree to which an asset or security can be quickly bought or sold in the market
        without affecting the asset's price.
   16
        (Order-book) depth is closely related to the liquidity of the market. A deep market can be expected to
        absorb larger buy and sell orders before an order moves the prices.
   17
        A bid-ask spread is the amount by which the ask price exceeds the bid price for an asset in the market.
        The bid-ask spread is essentially the difference between the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay
        for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept to sell it.
   18
        Accordingly, DBAG explains in its internal documents: "significant existing exposures primarily in a
        single currency across products under a single default fund lead to a higher efficiency in terms of
        funding & capital requirements". DBAG's internal documents, Eurex—Strategy compendium, January
        2015, page 37 [ID 3750-12574].
   19
        There is however no single terminology in the industry. In this Decision, the Commission uses the two
        terms as synonyms.
   20
        For instance, DBAG explains in its internal documents that "only a few players have the scale to deliver
        superior value and efficiency". Hence, larger platforms have the "[p]ossibility to exploit economies of
        scale from large order volume/ number of clients" and the "[p]ossibility to exploit economies of scope
        by offering services along the whole value chain". DBAG's internal document, "Eurex—Strategy
        compendium", January 2015, pages 18, 43 [ID 3750-12574].

          incumbency. In this context, DBAG explains in its internal documents that
          infrastructure markets are typically dominated by a leading provider: [BUSINESS
          SECRETS].21 The incumbency advantage typically translates into higher profit
          margins.22
   (61)   Second, as a result of these considerable network effects, economies of scale and
          scope, financial infrastructure markets are generally characterised by the existence of
          significant barriers to entry. Indeed, liquidity has a natural tendency to concentrate
          on a limited amount of platforms.
   (62)   This does not imply that there is no competition in these markets or that entries are
          always futile. Smaller competitors can impose a significant competitive threat on
          incumbents under certain circumstances, for example if they are well placed and
          have the necessary support by large liquidity providers. Also, established players can
          pose competitive threats if they are in a position to leverage strong positions in one
          market for entries into neighbouring markets.23 Finally, new and innovative unique
          selling propositions which distinguish a new entrant from established offerings can
          be a successful entry strategy. In this context the size of the specific market and the
          potential gains are also to be considered; entry attempts are generally more likely in
          large profitable markets than in smaller, more local markets.24
   (63)   Product/service differentiation either through superior product features or through
          unique selling points may help to mitigate or to overcome the network effects and
          sort users to different platforms thus permitting the co-existence of rival platforms.25
          Successful new entrants have typically been able to offer superior product features or
          technological improvements such as faster speed of execution, greater anonymity for
          block trades or more innovative pricing models. This has been observed both in the
          U.S., when Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) entered into competition
          with established U.S. exchanges such as Nasdaq and NYSE,26 and in Europe, when
          MTFs entered into competition with incumbent national exchanges27 targeting their
          offering to accommodate the needs of high frequency traders.28

   (64)    Horizontal differentiation (i.e. targeting one's offering towards a specific customer
           group) is a factor that permits an entrant to be successful and has been observed, for
           instance, in the famous "battle of the Bund" - an episode of intense competition in
           Bund futures, where the market ultimately shifted from the incumbent LIFFE to a
           new entrant (DTB, today part of DBAG's Eurex Group). Economic research found
           that DTB's ability to target buy-side traders directly (who had previously traded
           through a sell-side intermediary) was a key determinant in its successful entry.29
   (65)    Therefore, on a general level, there are regular entry attempts in large markets, and
           while they often fail, the mere fact that there are attempts shows that market
           participants and rational investors do not consider it impossible to overcome these
           barriers. If entry is successful, however, it can result in significant shifts in the
           market and the rewards for the new entrant could be considerable. This high risk /
           high reward profile of entries ensures that entry attempts happen regularly even
           though only a few of them succeed. Indeed, the threat of entry and the existence of
           alternatives30 do constrain incumbents and spur them to innovate more than would be
           the case absent competition. This idea was expressed in DBAG / NYSE Euronext as
           follows: "However, while for most ETDs, it has historically proven to be difficult in
           Europe to make the liquidity shift to any substantial extent to a different trading
           venue once liquidity has settled on the platform that "won" the battle, this does not
           mean that competition is over at that point of time and split liquidity is observed for
           a number of contracts. Indeed, the fact that liquidity has settled on one platform does
           not per se preclude competition… the mere threat that liquidity might shift, in whole
           or in part, to the other platform, is a credible constraint on the competitive
           behaviour of exchanges. In this context, exchanges keep each other on their toes
           constantly."31
   5.2.2.  Different customer groups
   (66)    Another important feature of financial markets resides in the heterogeneous demand-
           side composed of two broad categories of customers, namely the "sell-side"
           including large dealer banks including intermediaries and market makers, and the
           "buy-side" composed of hedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds, institutional
           investors and large corporates.
   (67)    The sell-side typically comprises direct customers of financial market infrastructure
           providers, who trade a large variety of financial instruments with the main aim of
           making a profit. The buy-side, on the other hand, are so called "end-users" of
           financial instruments which they use for investment or hedging purposes. Buy-side
           participants have traditionally accessed the financial markets through intermediaries.
           Recently, however, this has been changing as financial infrastructure providers have
           started to offer services to attract buy-side market participants.
   (68)    This heterogeneity has a number of implications on the way the two groups of
           market participants behave on the market. While in particular smaller buy-side
           customers tend to display some home bias (that is the tendency to trade on home
           markets as opposed to international market places), sell-side market participants and

            large buy-side customers are typically active on platforms across jurisdictions.
            Similarly, a number of buy-side market participants prefer executing transactions on
            regulated trading platforms (preferably even traditional exchanges as opposed to
            MTFs) while sell-side participants use both regulated markets and over-the-counter
            environments.
   5.2.3.   Regulatory framework
   (69)     As explained above, due to strong network effects and economies of scale and scope
            the provision of financial market infrastructure services is characterised by a high
            degree of concentration. For any given product, there are, generally speaking, few
            infrastructure providers offering it, or at least having a meaningful market share. As a
            result, one of the principal aims of regulatory initiatives in this industry is to mitigate
            the network effects by opening up the markets to competition.
   (70)     In 2007 the Markets in Financial Instrument Directive ("MiFID I"),32 aimed in
            particular at making financial markets more transparent and at liberalising the
            equities markets by opening access to the market for entities other than traditional
            exchanges33 (such as MTFs); and abolished the concentration rule, which required
            that trading be undertaken only on the trading venue of the listing. As a result, new
            competitors – the MTFs – emerged. The increase in the number of competitors
            changed the structure of the equities markets and, as a consequence of these
            dynamics, the markets have generally seen a reduction in the level of trading costs.34
            This new competition, besides having a positive impact (decrease) on the trading fee
            levels, also introduced innovation in the market with the emergence of new trading
            models and fee structures as well as technological innovations (for example reduced
            latency in trading).
   (71)     Currently, other areas of financial markets, ETDs in particular, are becoming subject
            to regulatory intervention through MiFID II35/MIFIR.36 These legislative instruments
            aim at mitigating network effects by, amongst other things, introducing open access
            provisions.
   (72)     Another driver in the industry stemming from the regulation is the increased need for
            margin and capital efficiencies sought after by customers. Indeed, the post-crisis
            regulation brought about higher capital requirements and the requirements to clear
            more financial instruments. Of importance in this regard is the revision37 of the
            capital requirements within the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking
            Supervision (the "Basel III" framework), which were implemented into EU law
            through the CRD IV package.38 The rules contained in the Capital Requirements
            Regulation ("CRR") and the Capital Requirements Directive ("CRD") required banks

          States was 31 January 2007.

          The revision followed and was prompted by the 2008 financial crisis, which revealed that banks had too
          little capital to absorb losses.
   38
          That is, Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the "Capital Requirements Regulation") and Directive
          2013/36/EU (the "Capital Requirements Directive").

            to increase the quality and quantity of capital they have. The Bank for International
            Settlements ("BIS") estimated that the incremental cost of increased regulatory
            capital39 is 6.7%,40 implying a cost of EUR 67 000 for every million EUR of
            additional capital. As a result, there is a tendency of customers to optimise their
            activities so that they minimise their overall costs.
   (73)     In view of the above, the Commission considers that the regulatory framework is an
            important backdrop against which the effects of mergers in financial infrastructure
            markets ought to be assessed.
   5.3.     LSEG's control over LCH.Clearnet
   (74)     Another important issue in the context of the assessment of the Transaction is the
            extent to which LSEG controls LCH.Clearnet and has the ability to influence its
            commercial behaviour.
   (75)     LCH.Clearnet consists of a holding structure where the holding company controls
            two separate legal entities: LCH.Clearnet Ltd. ("LCH Ltd"), based in London and
            LCH.Clearnet SA ("LCH SA"), based in Paris. [BUSINESS SECRETS].
   5.3.1.   Notifying Parties' views
   (76)     The Notifying Parties argued41 that, due to the specific governance structure put in
            place at the time of the acquisition of a majority stake in LCH.Clearnet by LSEG,
            LSEG's influence over the commercial behaviour of this clearing house is limited.
   (77)     Specifically, the Notifying Parties argue that LSEG does not exercise sufficient
            control over LCH.Clearnet to allow the merged entity to implement full or partial
            foreclosure strategies. They further underline this statement by claiming that LSEG's
            limited abilities to influence LCH.Clearnet's decision making do not extend to being
            able to determine key strategic decisions made by LCH.Clearnet for the interest of
            LSEG and against the interests of venues and users.
   (78)     The Notifying Parties further submit that LCH.Clearnet's commitment to provide
            open access on Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms prevents
            it from engaging in any type of foreclosure strategy. In addition, the Notifying
            Parties consider that forthcoming regulation and its pro-competitive effect on the
            market should also be taken into account.
   (79)     Finally, the Notifying Parties consider that they face significant buyer power
            exercised by trading platforms and user banks via the specific governance structure
            of LCH.Clearnet and in addition based on the constant threat of customers to support
            alternative clearing houses.
   5.3.2.   LCH.Clearnet Governance
   5.3.2.1. Contractual agreements
   (80)     LSEG holds a majority stake of almost 58% of LCH.Clearnet. [BUSINESS
            SECRETS]. From an accounting perspective, LCH.Clearnet is fully consolidated into
            LSEG. It accounts for approximately 25% of LSEG's total income at group level and
   39
           That is the cost of equity over the cost of debt.

            is referred to on an equal footing with other wholly owned subsidiaries in the group
            overview of the annual report.42
   (81)     LSEG's participation in LCH.Clearnet's governance is based on two main contractual
            arrangements: the Articles of Association of LCH.Clearnet ("Articles of
            Association") and the Relationship Agreement between LCH.Clearnet, London Stock
            Exchange Group, and London Stock Exchange Ltd. ("Relationship Agreement").43
            Both texts provide for rights and obligations of shareholders and define specific
            rights of LSEG which are discussed in further detail below.
   5.3.2.2. Board and senior management
   (82)     LCH.Clearnet's group level board comprises 17 directors in total, including the
            Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The remaining 15 directors fall
            into the following groups based on the type of shareholders they represent: four user
            directors representing large global banks (Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP
            Paribas, Barclays, and JP Morgan),44 three LSEG directors, two venue directors
            (representing Euronext and Nasdaq), and one customer director (currently the CEO
            of Amundi). The remaining five posts are held by independent non-executive
            directors (iNEDs).45
   (83)     While LSEG does not directly appoint a majority of board members for
            LCH.Clearnet Group, it needs to approve the candidates proposed for the seven
            directors appointed by the venues, customers, and users. Therefore, together with the
            direct appointment of the "LSEG directors" as well as the CEO, LSEG is involved
            directly or indirectly in the appointment of 11 out of 17 board members. In addition,
            the remaining five independent directors as well as the Chairman are to be
            independent and need to be approved by a shareholder's meeting where LSEG holds
            a majority.
   (84)     As regards LSEG’s team of senior executive officers, LSEG has the right to appoint
            and remove the CEO of LCH.Clearnet.46 The CEO is then responsible for the
            recruitment of senior managers and appoints the executive team of LCH.Clearnet on
            the group level. The CEO is delegated with the day-to-day responsibility of running
            LCH.Clearnet's operations and the implementation of the strategy and business plan
            as specified in the terms of the executive delegation, which may not be changed
            without LSEG's consent.47 In addition, it is specifically agreed that LCH.Clearnet's
            CEO has to consult with LSEG's CEO on the recruitment of senior executives,
            including the right of LSEG's CEO to meet with possible candidates.48 No other
            shareholder has comparable rights.

   5.3.2.3. Specific rights conferred on LSEG
   (86)     The Articles of Association and the Relationship Agreement provide three categories
            of matters for which specific rights of specific shareholders (or groups thereof) have
            been defined. These are so-called "LSEG consent matters",51 "push matters",52 and
            "minority protection reserved matters".53
   (87)     [LSEG CONSENT MATTERS INCLUDE THE REQUIREMENT FOR LSEG TO
            AGREE TO THE ADOPTION OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET AS WELL AS TO
            ANY MATERIAL VARIATION OF THE BUSINESS. THEY ALSO INCLUDE
            THE PROVISION THAT LSEG MUST POSITIVELY CONSENT TO ANY

   (88)     [IN PRACTICE, LSEG CONSENT MATTERS INCLUDE A RANGE OF
            DECISIONS AND WHILE THE NOTIFYING PARTIES CLAIM THEM TO BE
            "UNCOMMON", THEY ALSO SUBMIT THAT "THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER
            LSEG CONSENT MATTERS SINCE 1 MAY 2013, THE "MOST ROUTINE" OF
            WHICH IS THE ADOPTION OF NEW BUDGETS.].54 [THE RELATIONSHIP
            AGREEMENT SPECIFIES THAT "A LSEG CONSENT MATTER WILL NOT

            MATTERS THAT ARE CONSIDERED A CONSENT MATTER, LSEG HAS TO
            CONSENT TO ANY DECISION FALLING UNDER THESE SPECIFICALLY
            DEFINED CASES. NO OTHER SHAREHOLDER HAS CONSENT MATTER
            RIGHTS.].
   (89)     Similarly, the provisions on push matters enable LSEG to elevate matters for
            resolution by the shareholders, even if a decision by the board has already been
            taken.56 The possible content of push matters includes key elements for the strategic
            development of LCH.Clearnet like the expansion to new geographies and the
            admission of new venues wishing to become shareholders as well as material
            deviations from budget or business plan and any matter related to the company's IT
            strategy [BUSINESS SECRETS]. While the respective investment is also covered by
            the provisions on LSEG consent matters, the push matters provisions reinforce and
            clarify the influence of LSEG by specifically including strategy decisions, not only
            questions of the financial investments. In case a push matter has been raised, a
            decision has to be taken by the shareholders. A positive decision requires a majority

            of 60% of the votes cast on that matter, including 25% of the votes cast on that
            matter attached to shares cast by user shareholders.
   (90)     While this provision shows that LSEG requires additional support from user
            shareholders for a positive decision, it also demonstrates that LSEG is in a position to
            elevate matters as push matters and block a positive decision on them. [BUSINESS
            SECRETS].57 However, the fact remains that once a matter is raised as a push matter
            LSEG needs to agree before the matter can move forward (i.e. it has the possibility to
            block decisions). In addition, the very existence of these powers underlines the
            special powers of LSEG, given that no other shareholder can raise such a push
            matter.
   (91)     Finally, the minority protection reserved matters specify arrangements that can only
            be amended with the support of 80% of votes cast at a shareholder meeting. The
            minority protection reserved matters include any changes to the Relationship
            Agreement and the Articles of Association as well as the current shareholder
            structure. They also cover changes to the Core Operating Principles which are
            described further below.58 These matters are limited to typical minority shareholders
            protection rights, relating to the existing overall structure and purpose of the
            company. They do not affect the actual managerial decisions relevant for the
            development of LCH.Clearnet. As a result, the fact that LSEG cannot act unilaterally
            on these matters is irrelevant for the assessment of LSEG's control over
            LCH.Clearnet.
   5.3.2.4. Core operating principles
   (92)     In addition to the various matters referred to above, the Relationship Agreement sets
            out the core operating principles.59 These principles include the general commitment
            to open access under FRAND terms but also the status of LCH.Clearnet Group as a
            fully commercial for-profit business. With regards to LSEG they specify that any
            contractual relationship between LSEG and LCH.Clearnet should be conducted on
            arm's length commercial terms. The core operating principles also confer on LSEG
            the special right to exercise full discretion to determine whether and to what extent
            distributable profits are actually paid as dividends to all of LCH.Clearnet's
            shareholders.
   5.3.2.5. SwapClear Agreement
   (93)     SwapClear is a business unit of LCH Ltd and not a separate legal entity. There are
            specific contractual arrangements in place that provide a selective group of 14 banks
            that are among themselves organised in OTCDerivNet Ltd. (the "SwapClear
            banks")60 with additional influence over the clearing of OTC instruments offered by
            SwapClear.

   5.3.3.    The Commission's assessment
   (97)      The degree of influence that LSEG is able to exercise over LCH.Clearnet is relevant
             for several issues related to the assessment of the Transaction. All of the concerns
             that are directly related to clearing services provided by LCH.Clearnet or any of its
             subsidiaries are affected by the direct or indirect control that LSEG has over its
             clearing houses. In relation to vertical concerns, the question of effective influence is
             also important because it is a prerequisite for any potential ability to foreclose or
             otherwise impede competition.
   (98)      The assessment of LSEG's control over LCH.Clearnet has to be based on the ability
             to effectively influence the decision making within the clearing house, based on the
             factual and contractual powers conferred upon LSEG. The Notifying Parties'
             arguments that relate to historic developments and the intention behind the
             structuring of the contractual relations63 are therefore less important than the final
             rules as set down in the relevant agreements. In addition, it is also not relevant for the
             assessment if LSEG has actually fully exploited its powers in the pre-merger context
             given that incentives for a specific behaviour could change because of the
             Transaction.
   (99)      The assessment can also only be based on the existing arrangements and does not
             assume any change in the relevant governance framework post-Transaction as the
             Notifying Parties seem to suggest.64
   5.3.3.1. LSEG has at least negative control over LCH.Clearnet Group
   (100)     The Commission's Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice under Council Regulation
             (EC) No 139/2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the
             "Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice")65 provides guidelines to assess means of
             control. According to the Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice, it is not necessary to
             show that decisive influence is or will actually be exercised. Rather, the effective
             possibility of exercising such influence, based on rights, contracts, or other means

           should be taken into account.66 In addition, the Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice
           specifies that sole control over an entity is not only given in situations where one
           entity possesses the power to determine strategic commercial decisions of another
           entity but also in situations of negative control where one entity possesses specific
           veto powers that are sufficient to produce a deadlock situation without having to
           cooperate with other shareholders.67
   (101)   While LCH.Clearnet's governance structure contains certain particularities, the
           Commission considers that LSEG can exercise at least negative sole control over
           LCH.Clearnet in which it holds a majority stake and that is fully consolidated in its
           accounts.
   (102)   The Commission takes the following specific elements of control into consideration:
           First, the Commission notes that influence may not only follow from price related
           decisions, but also from influencing key business decisions in a broader sense. In this
           regard, also minority shareholdings can be used to limit the ability of target
           companies to compete effectively.68 The Commission has found before that influence
           on a company even based on minority shareholdings can lead to a possible
           elimination of competition.69
   (103)   With regards to competition concerns related to pricing decisions, it should be
           considered that relevant control is not limited to openly rising direct fees,70 but can
           also be exercised by the blockage of possible price reductions. In this respect, pricing
           decisions within LCH.Clearnet can be taken at [BUSINESS SECRETS]71, 72
   (104)   [WHILE THE LARGE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS ARE REPRESENTED AT THE

         the ability to influence the commercial policy and strategy of a corporation based on minority
         investments which could be used to block special resolutions, restricting abilities to issue shares and
         raise capital, and to limit the ability to effectively manage portfolios of relevant assets (CC report on
         Ryanair Holdings plc and Aer Lingus Group plc dated 28 August 2013, paragraphs 7.23 et seq.;

         Fee increases can however not be ruled out in general, as it is not contested by the Notifying Parties that
         such increases have taken place for different reasons at several points in time (Notifying Parties' reply
         to SO, part F, paragraph 581). Results of the market investigation also identify that such increases have
         occurred in the past (Replies to questionnaire Q11 "Sell-side customers", question 179).

           LSEG'S GROUP CEO,] the Commission considers that LSEG can at least indirectly
           influence pricing decisions.
   (106)   The Commission also notes that the FRAND commitment [BUSINESS SECRETS]
           does not, in itself, set an absolute ceiling to a price and thus prevent price increases.
           It would also not prevent a differentiated price increase for specific customer groups
           as described above as long as all customers falling within one of the two categories
           are treated equally.
   (107)   In addition to price changes, the Commission also notes that LSEG can exercise
           effective influence over other relevant decisions such as those related to innovation.
   (108)   First, when it comes to technological innovations, LSEG’s rights related to its
           consent matters enable it to veto significant investments in IT projects.
   (109)   Second, when it comes to the introduction of new products, LSEG's control is
           particularly important in relation to the provision of merchant clearing services.
           Euronext is one specific example of a venue that depends on clearing by
           LCH.Clearnet. In order for Euronext to be able to compete with market participants
           like Eurex, it has to regularly introduce new products. [REDACTED PART
           DESCRIBES AN EXAMPLE OF PAST INTERACTION BETWEEN LCH AND
           EURONEXT].73 Given LSEG's ability [TO IMPACT EURONEXT'S ABILITY TO
           INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS QUICKLY AND AT COMPETITIVE TERMS],
           it is plausible that LSEG could [BUSINESS SECRETS] at least prevent any future
           improvements to the [BUSINESS SECRETS] processes that led to the
           [EXPERIENCE REPORTED BY EURONEXT].
   (110)   Finally, the market investigation generally confirmed that LSEG's influence in
           LCH.Clearnet is real. For instance, some market participants indicated that LSEG
           has "significant" influence over LCH.Clearnet74 which is also described as
           "dominating"75 and leading to a "strategic alignment"76 between both LSEG and
           LCH.Clearnet. Specifically the replies of shareholders of LCH.Clearnet are very
           noticeable in this context when mentioning that LSEG has an important "say in
           strategic planning […] including topics of a commercial nature and product
           development".77

   (111)     Moreover, it is noteworthy that the proposed merger between LSEG and DBAG
             [DOES NOT REQUIRE CONSULTATION WITH SHAREHOLDERS ON THE
             TRANSACTION].78
   (112)     Finally, in its analysis of the acquisition of LCH.Clearnet Group by LSEG79 the
             Office of Fair Trading ("OFT") considered that the governance structure put in place
             does not exclude influence by LSEG over LCH.Clearnet.80 Specifically, the OFT
             noted that "the corporate governance and open-access provisions set out in the
             transaction agreements and UK regulatory framework would not, in themselves,
             prevent the Notifying Parties' ability to engage in partial foreclosure"81 and that "the
             Notifying Parties would be likely to retain the ability to engage in partial foreclosure
             strategies (namely a uniform price rise and/or quality degradation)".82 The decision
             of the OFT to nevertheless not oppose the proposed transaction was based on the fact
             that the incentives for any anti-competitive behaviour were limited given the relevant
             competitive landscape at the time of the transaction. In this scenario, LCH.Clearnet
             had incentives to distribute its services to other trading venues because LSEG was
             not a relevant competitor in any of the areas where potential customer platforms of
             merchant clearing services would compete. This is significantly different in the
             current case, where LCH.Clearnet serves direct competitors of Eurex.
   (113)     In light of the above, the Commission concludes that LSEG has significantly more
             influence over decision making processes within LCH.Clearnet than any other
             shareholder. Even if LSEG cannot necessarily unilaterally impose its strategy on
             LCH.Clearnet in all cases, it has the means to block key decisions which would lead
             to dead-lock situations, significantly affecting LCH.Clearnet's future development.
   5.3.3.2. The SwapClear Agreement
   (114)     The Notifying Parties claim that [BUSINESS SECRETS] would counterbalance
             [BUSINESS SECRETS].
   (115)     The Commission takes note of additional rights conferred upon the SwapClear banks
             in the SwapClear Agreement, including the [RIGHTS IN RELATION TO
             TERMINATION]. However, the Commission notes that this agreement covers only
             the activities of SwapClear, namely the clearing of OTC traded interest rate
             derivatives ("IRD"). It has no bearing on the ability of LSEG to control
             LCH.Clearnet in general and is therefore not relevant for LCH.Clearnet's activities
           specifically CurveGlobal as one example (Nomura reply to questionnaire Q11 "Sell-side customers and
           issuers", question 178.3, [ID 5338]).

           While the Notifying Parties suggest that the OFT has based its clearing decision on the analysis of the
           governance structures in place, a closer look to this assessment reveals a different picture. While the
           OFT has considered the specific system in place, it stated: "the OFT does not rely on the specific
           corporate governance provisions in its decision to mitigate any competition concerns, it is only one of a
           number of factors the OFT has taken into account in reaching a decision". (OFT decision ME/5464-12

             related to those markets where the Commission concludes that significant
             impediment to effective competition would arise as a result of the Transaction.
   (116)     As a result, for the purposes of this Decision, it is not necessary for the Commission
             to conclude on whether, or to what extent, SwapClear banks would have the ability
             to defeat any attempts by the merged entity to exercise market power.
   5.3.3.3. Conclusion on LSEG's control over LCH.Clearnet Group
   (117)     In light of the above, and for the purposes of the assessment of this case, the
             Commission concludes that LSEG has at least negative control over key decisions of
             LCH.Clearnet, including price setting.83 The core operating principles do not
             effectively limit LSEG's ability to implement anti-competitive behaviour as long as is
             not openly discriminatory.

             date. Interest is generally paid at pre-determined levels and predetermined intervals.
             As in the case of equities, services related to bonds include listing, trading, clearing,
             settlement and custody. However, aspects of the life cycle of a bond that are specific
             to this financial instrument are set out below.
   (119)     Bonds are initially issued by borrowers, i.e. governments (public issuers),
             supranational (quasi-government) organisations (for example the European Central
             Bank or public companies) or private companies (including financial institutions)
             and are, on this basis, classified as "government bonds", "supranational bonds" and
             "corporate bonds" respectively.
   (120)     After their issuance, bonds are sold by issuers to investors in the "primary market",
             either through bond auctions or through bought deals.
   (121)     In bond auctions, certain market making banks pitch to attain a share of the issue
             with a view to either place it directly with investors or progressively sell it on the
             secondary market. Access to these auctions is usually restricted to pre-selected banks
             ("primary dealers") which are appointed by the issuer or the local debt management
             office ("DMO") to buy, promote and distribute government bonds on the secondary
             market. This mechanism (referred to as primary dealer regime) is specific to
             government bond issues.
   (122)     In a bought deal, which is the standard procedure for corporate bonds, the bank (also
             called syndicate bank) that will eventually buy ("underwrite") the issue at a set price
             is selected on the basis of bids submitted to the issuer.
   (123)     Listing is the practice of including a particular cash security (in this case a bond) on a
             Regulated Market ("RM") in the meaning of MiFID I. The decision on whether to list
   83
           In any event, focusing solely on the ability of LSEG to increase prices in LCH.Clearnet (including
           SwapClear) would be missing the key fact that Eurex will be free to increase such prices on its end, as
           neither absent the Transaction, nor post-Transaction banks have any say on pricing decisions of Eurex.

           or not to list a particular bond and the choice of listing venue is driven by the issuer
           (usually indicated in their prospectus). Unlisted bonds can also be in principle
           admitted for trading on the secondary market (on a venue or OTC).
   (124)   Usually bonds are negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be
           transferred in the secondary market. Investors can sell or buy (i.e. trade) bonds in the
           secondary market any time up until maturity or early redemption. Bonds are usually
           traded much less frequently than equities (with the exception of some very liquid
           bonds such as for example German government bonds that are traded very regularly).
           This is mainly due to the fact that many investors hold the bond until maturity (buy-
           to-hold investors). Market makers therefore play a central role in this space by
           providing liquidity.
   (125)   The bond market is characterised by a two-tiered trading structure that includes a
           dealer-to-client ("D2C") space where market-making dealers provide liquidity
           directly to their customers (i.e. buy-side firms which include asset managers,
           insurance companies, etc.) and a dealer-to-dealer ("D2D") segment where market
           making dealers manage their inventory risk and source liquidity from other dealers
           (i.e. sell-side firms) for their respective clients business. Within these two segments,
           various execution environments exist: on the one hand, inter-dealer platforms /
           broker operated electronic venues (which include RM/MTFs84 and are D2D), on the
           other hand, multi-dealer platforms (including RM/MTFs) and single dealer platforms
           (which are both D2C). Bonds can be traded electronically on the platforms listed
           above, by voice (also through voice brokers) or through hybrid execution.
   (126)   There are essentially three types of "risk management" options for bond trades,
           namely CCP clearing, uncleared trading with bilateral settlement (where buyers and
           sellers make their own arrangements to manage each other's risk of default) and
           matched principal trading. In matched principal trading, a facilitator (usually an
           inter-dealer broker) interposes itself between the buyer and the seller of a transaction
           in such a way that it is never exposed to market risk throughout the execution of the
           transaction, with both sides executed simultaneously, and the transaction is
           concluded at a price where the facilitator makes no profit or loss, other than a
           previously disclosed commission, fee or charge for the transaction.85
   (127)   Similarly to equities, settlement (which involves the transfer of the purchased
           securities by book entry against payment) is the final step of the life cycle for bonds.
   (128)   An assessment of the impact of the transaction on settlement and custody services for
           fixed income (i.e. bonds and repurchase agreements) is conducted in Section 8.

   (132)    All trades executed on Eurex Bonds are cleared by Eurex Clearing (ECAG).
   (133)    DBAG also provides settlement and custody services for cash instruments, including
            bonds, through its subsidiaries Clearstream Banking (Frankfurt) AG ("CBF") and
            Clearstream Banking (Luxembourg) S.A. ("CBL").
   (134)    LSEG provides cash bonds listing services via LSE and Borsa Italiana.
   (135)    LSEG provides trading services for bonds via the LSE by operating ORB, an
            electronic Order Book for Retail Bonds, and OFIS, the Order Book for Fixed Income
            Securities. Through Borsa Italiana, LSEG operates MTS (which is 60.37% owned by
            Borsa Italiana), which operates different trading venues for the secondary trading of
            fixed income products, including MTS Cash, MTS Bondvision and MTS BondsPro.
            In addition Borsa Italiana operates Mercato Obbligazionario Telematico (MOT),
            ExtraMOT (the Group’s Italian retail bond trading platforms), and EuroTLX, a
            majority-owned MTF in the European retail fixed income market.
   (136)    Bonds traded on MTS' venues are cleared by various clearing houses, namely LCH
            SA, LCH Ltd and CC&G.

            bonds, via Monte Titoli (the Italian CSD).86
   6.2.     Market definition
   (138)    In the sections below, the Commission only assesses the impact of the Transaction
            on CCP clearing of bonds, as it is the only layer of the bonds value chain (among
            listing, trading and clearing) in relation to which the Commission concludes that the
            Transaction would lead to a significant impediment to effective competition.
   6.2.1.   Notifying Parties' views
   (139)    In the Form CO and in their response to the Decision opening the proceedings, the
            Notifying Parties consider that an overall market for "risk management" of bonds,
            comprising all "risk management" options, including clearing through a CCP as well
            as bilateral settlement and matched principal trading (despite being distinct, these
            latter two options are referred to by the Notifying Parties together as the "uncleared"
            options) should be considered. In their response to the Statement of Objections, the
            Notifying Parties reiterate their claim that the Commission's analysis is based on an
            artificially narrow market for CCP clearing of bonds which disregards the
            competitive pressure posed by other uncleared forms of "risk management".
   (140)    According to the Notifying Parties, CCPs face significant competitive constraint
            from uncleared trades, which constitute the vast majority of all cash bonds trades
            (80-90%).
   86
          LSEG also owns globeSettle SA, a newly established CSD and ICSD in Luxembourg, currently only
          active in relation to equities. By nature, globeSettle is not a traditional CSD (not having a captive
          market of reference) and, as such, globeSettle can be characterised as both a CSD and an ICSD. This
          distinction between CSD and ICSD thus only serves to describe the commercial practice of globeSettle
          and does not indicate any limitation on the services that it can provide as either a CSD, on the one hand,
          or an ICSD, on the other.

   (141)     In this respect, the Notifying Parties argue that customers (including LSEG MTS'
             customers) usually have the choice of whether to clear a trade via a CCP or to rely on
             other forms of "risk management" (i.e. bilateral settlement or matched principal
             trading through an interdealer broker).
   (142)     The Notifying Parties further argue that in particular matched principal trading is a
             close substitute to CCP clearing at least in the D2D space and offers comparable
             benefits.
   (143)     The Notifying Parties submit that the geographic scope of the market for bonds
             clearing services is EEA-wide.
   6.2.2.    The Commission's assessment
   (144)     In its previous practice, the Commission considered the possibility to distinguish
             clearing services by type of customer, i.e. a segmentation between (i) a merchant
             market for the provision of clearing services to trading platforms on the one hand;
             and (ii) a downstream market for the provision of clearing services to CCP
             customers, on the other hand, but left open whether a separate market for the
             provision of cash clearing services to third party trading venues and platforms
             exists.87
   6.2.2.1. CCP clearing of bonds should be considered separately from CCP clearing of other
             asset classes
   (145)     The Commission firstly considers that, under the narrowest possible market
             definition, CCP clearing of bonds should be analysed separately from CCP clearing
             of other asset classes.88
   (146)     From a demand-side perspective, customers' demand usually relates to the clearing of
             individual transactions, in this case of individual bond transactions, pointing to the
             existence of a market limited to CCP clearing of bonds
   (147)     In addition, in relation to supply-side substitutability, certain elements indicate that
             the degree of supply-side substitutability between CCP clearing of bonds and CCP
             clearing of other asset classes is limited.
   (148)     First, clearing requires specific authorisations per asset class and depends on
             instrument specific expertise and technology, even if the basic infrastructure would
             appear to be common across financial instruments.
   (149)     In addition, clearing houses that offer one category of instruments are unlikely to
             start offering clearing of another category of instruments within a relatively short
             time frame and without incurring significant investment costs89 (including building
             out workflow, creating or adapting a guarantee fund, devising risk models,
             purchasing underlying data, adopting or creating new IT systems, establishing
             connections etc.). In addition, in view of the importance of clearing houses from a
             systemic risk point of view, launching clearing also (and importantly) requires a
   87
           See Case COMP/M.6166 – DBAG / NYSE Euronext, paragraph 89.
   88
           This is without prejudice to the potential existence of a wider market for the provision of integrated
           clearing services which is discussed in Section 10.

             detailed regulatory review. Obtaining the necessary approvals for a new clearing
             service (i.e. for a new asset class) therefore cannot be done swiftly.
   (150)     The lack of immediate supply-side substitutability from clearing of one asset class
             into clearing another is also illustrated by the attempts of some established equities
             clearing houses, such as EuroCCP, to penetrate adjacent clearing markets (in the case
             of EuroCCP, stock loans).
   (151)     As explained by EuroCCP itself (which is only active in the clearing of equities
             space), the process of bringing to the market a new, even if due to the underlying,
             closely related clearing service, entails a very time consuming and investment
             intensive effort. According to EuroCCP, entering a totally new asset class, for
             example entering the fixed income clearing space (i.e. clearing of repos and bonds)
             would be particularly burdensome, and it "would take significantly longer, entail
             much higher investments (in terms e.g. of risk management enhancement, validation,
             etc.) and increased fixed costs, while commercial barriers to entry are also much
             higher", compared to for example expanding into other equities clearing (for
             example equities lending).90
   (152)     Therefore, the Commission concludes that for the purposes of this Decision a
             separate market for CCP clearing of bonds should be considered.
   6.2.2.2. CCP clearing of bonds and other forms of "risk management" of bonds do not form
             part of the same market
   (153)     The Commission has not previously considered whether CCP clearing of bonds and
             other "risk management" options for bonds form part of the same product market.
   (154)     In the Decision opening the proceedings and in the Statement of Objections, the
             Commission preliminarily identified a separate market for the provision of CCP
             clearing services for bonds in the EEA.
   (155)     In this respect, the results of the Phase II market investigation confirmed that, while
             alternative forms of "risk management" (bilateral settlement and matched principal
             trading) remain very relevant in the bonds' space, a separate demand for CCP cleared
             bonds exists, will continue to exist and is bound to increase in the near future.
   (156)     First, a significant number of sell-side customers centrally clear at least part of their
             bond trades through a CCP.91 In addition, while some buy-side customers either do
             not clear any of their bond trades or clear only a small part of them, 92 several other
             respondents stated that they clear the entirety or the near entirety of their bond
             trades.93 On this basis, while it is acknowledged by the Commission that some

           Objections, the Notifying Parties contest the Commission's interpretation of the replies to this question
           and consider that of the 25 market participants who responded to this question 9 said that they clear
           100% of their bonds through a CCP, 8 said that they clear 0% of their trades and 8 cited a "percentage
           somewhere in between" and infer from this that market participants have a "flexible" approach to
           clearing. The Commission does not agree with the Notifying Parties' presentation of the results of the
           market investigation and notes that out of the 8 respondents that, according to the Notifying Parties,

           customers either do not clear their bonds' trades though a CCP or they only clear a
           percentage of their bonds trades, the market investigation indicates that, at least for
           some customers, CCP clearing is viewed as the preferred, if not the only, option.
   (157)   Furthermore, a significant number of sell-side customers that responded to the
           Commission's Phase II market investigation do not appear to consider CCP clearing,
           matched principal trading and bilateral settlement as substitutable options.94 More
           specifically, they do not consider CCP clearing to be substitutable with bilateral
           settlement95 or matched principal trading.96
   (158)   With specific reference to matched principal trading, the Phase II market
           investigation did not confirm the Notifying Parties' argument that this option is
           widely considered as a substitute of CCP clearing.97 When asked to compare CCP
           clearing with matched principal trading in terms of, for example, counterparty risk,
           netting or any other relevant parameter, only a few respondents considered these
           options as comparable. On the contrary, respondents indicated that CCP clearing
           differs from other forms of "risk management", due, among other things, to credit
           risk reduction, settlement risk reduction or netting efficiencies provided by CCPs.
           One market participant stated that: "Credit risk reduction and netting are higher
           when we operate with CCP."98 Another market participant responded that they are
           not comparable as "the safety of ccp clearing is not comparable in other type of
           settlements where ccp is not involved."99 In addition, another market participant
           stated that "From a rates perspective CCP is preferable for netting to reduce
           settlement risk and also counterparty credit risk reduction benefits."100
   (159)   The market investigation provided evidence that, while due to the nature of the bonds
           market, "uncleared" still constitutes the most used way of settling a bond transaction,
           market participants acknowledge that clearing through a CCP still proves to be
           advantageous vis-à-vis other forms of risk management also in relation to bonds. In
         cited a percentage "somewhere in between", 5 respondents stated that they clear a percentage of their
         trades ranging from 90 to 99% (1 respondent said more than 70% and 2 respondents stated less than
         5%).

         In their response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties submit "the Commission seeks to
         diminish the relevance of matched principal trading" and cite the replies to questionnaire Q1, "Sell-side
         Customers", question 114 to support their contention. The Commission does not agree with the
         Notifying Parties' presentation of the results of the market investigation and notes that among the 11
         respondents to this question stating that they use more options, only one respondent (Lloyds) mentions
         matched principal trading, suggesting that market participants either clear through a CCP or settle
         bilaterally their bonds, rarely considering matched principal trading as a relevant option. In addition,
         when explicitly asked to compare CCP clearing and matched principal trading in question 75 of
         questionnaire Q11 "Sell side customers and issuers", out of 31 informative responses, 7 market
         participants said they do not use or know matched principal trading, only 3 said that the two systems
         can be considered "comparable" or that "differences are minimal", while all the remaining respondents
         list specific distinguishing features of CCP clearing and/or matched principal and many of them find
         CCP clearing more efficient.

           this respect, a market participant stated that they prefer central clearing because "it
           reduces credit risk and operational costs associated with it."101 According to another
           market participant "Clearing of bond transactions provides several advantages – it
           removes considerations about the credit worthiness of counterparties, and instantly
           broadens the number of counterparties with whom one can trade. The removal of
           credit risk from the trade decision makes prices from counterparties fungible and
           central clearing greatly simplifies settlement. Clearing also enables one to enjoy
           netting benefits and lower risk capital charges in facing a CCP as opposed to other
           counterparties in the period between trading and settlement. Lastly, central clearing
           can allow for pre and post trade anonymity to exist since the counterparties have no
           need to be made aware of the identity of the other party."102 The same market
           participant stated that "the regulatory regime incentivizes clearing over non-cleared
           activity. Consequently to the extent that CCPs are capable of managing the risk
           associated with the instrument e.g. liquidation risk in a default, banks are motivated
           to use clearing."103 The fact that customers do not consider CCP clearing as
           substitutable with "uncleared" options is further evidenced by the fact that the large
           majority of respondents do not systematically compare the options of central clearing
           through a CCP and trading without centrally clearing (matched principal and/ or
           bilateral settlement).104
   (160)   Even more importantly, when asked how they would react to a 5-10% increase in
           clearing fees (i.e. a small but significant and non-transitory increase of price
           ("SSNIP")), the majority of sell-side customers that provided informative answers to
           the Commission's question responded that they would continue to centrally clear
           their trades and only a minority of respondents would switch to trading without
           clearing through a CCP.105 Also, some customers do not have internal mandates to
           transact on an uncleared market.106

         Replies to questionnaire Q11 "Sell-side Customers and issuers", question 81. The Notifying Parties
         contest the Commission's analysis of the responses to this question and claim that the Commission has
         incorrectly reported the results of the SNIPP test in the Statement of Objections. In particular, the
         Notifying Parties consider that the answers of those that responded "Other" and stated that they would
         evaluate the specific conditions should be considered as a further indication that CCP clearing and other
         options should be considered as substitutable. The Commission notes that 19 respondents stated that
         they would continue to centrally clear, 8 respondents answered that they would go uncleared and 15
         respondents answered "other". Out of these 15, 5 responded "N/A" or stated that they do not currently
         clear their bonds trades. Out of the other 10, the large majority did not provide informative answers or
         answers that would alter the Commission's analysis of the SNIPP test. For example, IW Bank stated that
         "We would continue to offer bond trading to our customers, but customers fees may be increased";
         Credit Agricole stated that: "At this stage, it is difficult for us to answer this hypothetical question";
         BNY Mellon answered: "It would very much depend upon which credit standing of counterparties with
         whom one was trading, the netting and capital benefits available from clearing and the trading margins
         available to cover the increased costs. To the extent that there was competition between CCPs, as there
         has been in equity clearing, one might expect price and innovation competition between the CCPs to
         alleviate such cost increases."

   (161)   The existence of a separate demand for CCP cleared bonds is also acknowledged by
           the Notifying Parties in their internal documents. For example, [BUSINESS
           SECRETS]107
   (162)   While it is uncontestable that "uncleared" options including matched principal are
           still prevalent in terms of volumes, the Phase II market investigation yielded
           evidence that the demand for CCP clearing of bonds not only exists but is bound to
           increase also at the expense of matched principle trading as a result of the upcoming
           regulatory changes.108
   (163)   In this context, one market participant stated that "in view of forthcoming regulation,
           clearing bonds will become more advantageous as compared to other alternatives. In
           the specific, we can consider regulations such EMIR, IFRS 9 and Basel 3 important
           steps towards a more and more centralized clearing activity."109 Another market
           participant explained that "[…] Centrally clearing could become more advantageous
           under the CSDR regulation which is aimed to reduce the number of failing trades. If
           centrally clearing is linked to guaranteed delivery this option could become more
           valuable."110
   (164)   In addition, one of the Notifying Parties' competitors, an interdealer broker that
           offers matched principal trading to its customers, after having explained the reasons
           why CCP clearing is not particularly common compared to "uncleared" forms of
           "risk management" in the bonds' space, stated that this "current market structure will
           change dramatically with the onset of MiFID II where the rules surrounding non-
           discretionary execution on MTFs will ban matched-principal trading. As MTFs will
           need to offer centrally cleared or name give up access111 after January 2018112 it is
           likely that the adoption of central clearing will rise significantly and therefore the
           competitive impact of merging execution and clearing will be much more significant
           than is the case today."113
   (165)   This regulatory push towards clearing is also acknowledged and viewed by the
           Notifying Parties as an opportunity to leverage their position in their internal
           documents. [BUSINESS SECRETS]114 In their response to the Statement of

         Agreed minutes of a teleconference call with BGC of 20 October 2016, [ID 6076]. In relation to the
         difference between matched principal trading and name give up, BGC explained that "BGC's matched-
         principal protocol [is] where BGC becomes the counterparty to each party to the trade" while in
         bilateral name give up "BGC does not become principal to the trade, it arranges the trade and gives
         the name of the other party to each customer. In case of name-give up execution, the counterparties to
         the trade are responsible for the risk management and settlement.".
   112
         BGC refers to Article 19.5 MiFID II that provides that: "Member States shall not allow investment firms
         or market operators operating an MTF to execute client orders against proprietary capital, or to
         engage in matched principal trading". In relation to Organized Trading Facilities ("OTFs"), Article 20
         MiFIR limits the possibility of matched principle trading for the new venues only to cases where "the
         client has consented to the process". While it is generally expected that interdealer brokers may register
         as OTFs as pointed out by the Notifying Parties in their response to the Statement of Objections, this is
         at this stage at the very least uncertain.

             Objections, the Notifying Parties did not comment on the evidentiary value of this
             internal document.
   (166)     Therefore, the Commission concludes that, for the purposes of this Decision, in
             particular as regards bonds, CCP clearing and other forms of "risk management" do
             not form part of the same product market. Hence, for the purposes of this Decision, a
             separate product market for CCP clearing of bonds should be considered.
   6.2.2.3. Any possible further sub-segmentation of the market for CCP clearing of bonds can
             be left open
   (167)     In the Decision opening the proceedings and in the Statement of Objections, the
             Commission left open the question whether the market for CCP clearing services for
             bonds should be further sub-segmented on the basis of the other potential
             segmentations, for example the type and liquidity of the bond (for example German
             government bonds) that is cleared or whether the bond that is cleared is traded D2D
             and D2C. The Phase II market investigation did not provide any clear evidence in
             this respect, although it provided some indications that government bonds tend to be
             more often centrally cleared than corporate bonds115 and that D2D bond trades are
             more commonly cleared than D2C trades.
   (168)     In any event, the question of whether the market for CCP clearing services for bonds
             should be further segmented on the basis, for example, of the type and liquidity of
             the bond that is cleared or on the basis of whether the bond that is cleared is traded
             D2C or D2D can be left open for the purposes of this Decision as it does not affect
             the Commission's competitive assessment in relation to bonds.
   6.2.2.4. Geographic market definition
   (169)     As regards geographic market definition, in DBAG /NYSE Euronext,116 the notifying
             parties submitted that the market for cash clearing was at least EEA wide. The
             Commission ultimately left the market definition open.
   (170)     The market investigation in this case did not yield any evidence that would contradict
             the Notifying Parties' claim that the geographic scope of the market for bonds
             clearing services is EEA wide.
   (171)     The market investigation showed that market participants generally purchase clearing
             services for bonds in the EEA.117
   (172)     Therefore, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of this Decision, the
             market for CCP clearing of bonds is EEA-wide.
   6.2.2.5. Conclusion on relevant market
   (173)     Therefore, for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission considers that the
             relevant market in relation to bonds is the market for CCP clearing of bonds in the
             EEA.

   6.3.     Competitive assessment
   6.3.1.   The Transaction would strengthen LSEG's dominant position in the market for CCP
            clearing of bonds in the EEA
   6.3.1.1. Notifying Parties' views
   (174)    In their submissions, the Notifying Parties argue that, even if only a separate market
            for CCP clearing of bonds were to be considered, the Transaction would not lead to
            competition concerns.
   (175)    First, in the Notifying Parties' view, other forms of "risk management" (even if they
            are considered to form part of a separate market vis-à-vis CCP clearing), pose a
            significant competitive out-of-market constraint.
   (176)    The Notifying Parties claim that they are not close competitors since DBAG provides
            bonds clearing services only for its own trading venues (hence is not active on a
            merchant market for clearing), while LSEG's clearing houses also offer clearing
            services to non-vertically integrated third party venues. As a result, if LCH.Clearnet
            raised prices of clearing services, customers would also have to move their trades to
            Eurex Bonds if they wanted to switch to ECAG. In addition, due to the limited trade
            flow of bonds which is cleared [BUSINESS SECRETS], in the Notifying Parties'
            view, this renders the possibility of uncleared trades a closer alternative to clearing
            through LCH.Clearnet than ECAG.
   (177)    In addition, the Notifying Parties submit that the Transaction cannot give rise to
            competition concerns, as [NOTIFYING PARTIES DESCRIPTION OF ECAG
            POSITIONING, CONTAINING BUSINESS SECRETS].
   (178)    The Notifying Parties argue that other CCPs are present in the bonds clearing space
            and that sponsored entry of CCPs that are currently active in the clearing of other
            asset classes could occur.
   (179)    Finally, the Notifying Parties also argue that the merged entity will not have the
            ability or the incentive to foreclose rival trading platforms (for example BrokerTec)
            in the light of the LCH.Clearnet open access model approach.
   6.3.1.2. The Commission's assessment
   (180)    In 2015, the Notifying Parties had a combined market share in CCP clearing of bonds
            in the EEA of [90-100%] by value, with an increment brought by ECAG of [0-5%].
            LSEG's clearing houses' respective market shares accounted for [40-50%] (LCH
            SA), [5-10%] (LCH Ltd) and [30-40%] (CC&G).118
   (181)    The remaining CCPs which account for a very small fraction of the market (each
            with a market share of well below [0-5%]) do not constitute a credible alternative as
            they are very small local players with a narrow geographic focus (for example,
            Keller, KDPW, CCP Austria, Nasdaq OMX and BME). A market participant
            confirmed that other CCPs do not play a significant role in the market by stating that:
            "[…] other competitors existing in the market only offer clearing of a smaller range
            of products."119 Further, SIX x-clear only appears to have achieved a very marginal

           presence in the bonds' clearing space.120 A market participant described SIX as
           "strongly limited regionally."121
   (182)   The nearly monopolistic market shares of LSEG ([90-100%] overall) and the
           elimination of the only other competitor of any significance in the market already
           provide strong indications that the merger will strengthen LSEG's dominant position
           in the market for CCP clearing of bonds. The Commission acknowledges that, as put
           forward by the Notifying Parties in their submissions, the bond market is
           characterised by a variety of different options available to customers when entering
           into a bond transaction, including the possibility to trade and clear through an
           integrated trading / clearing facility (like DBAG's), the possibility to trade on one
           platform and clear through a CCP (for example trade on MTS or BrokerTec and clear
           through LCH), the possibility to trade OTC and register the trade for CCP clearing,
           the possibility to trade on a platform and settle bilaterally, the possibility to trade
           OTC via an interdealer broker offering matched principal trading. The Commission
           considers that, as also indicated by the market investigation,122 customers can and
           often do use the different options that are available to them, but these options are not
           necessarily substitutable as the Notifying Parties suggest. In this respect, as discussed
           in detail in Section 6.2.2. above, the market investigation indicated that a separate
           demand for CCP clearing exists. On that basis, to the extent customers want to clear
           their bond trades, they necessarily have to clear through one of the Notifying Parties'
           CCPs, i.e. the only players that are credibly able to address this demand.
   (183)   The Commission further notes that, despite the fact that DBAG does not offer bonds'
           merchant clearing at present,123 the Notifying Parties' clearing components are, at
           least indirectly, competing.124
   (184)   In this respect, the market investigation indicated that customers or at least some
           customers compare these different trading/clearing offerings, including MTS /
           LCH.Clearnet and Eurex (or BrokerTec / LCH.Clearnet).125 When asked about the
           clearing houses where they want to clear their bond trades, customers that responded
           to the market investigation listed ECAG alongside LSEG's clearing houses.126In
           contrast, the market investigation did not provide any evidence that any other
           competitor has a meaningful presence or in any way constrains the Notifying Parties.
   (185)   The Commission further considers that the Notifying Parties' claim that going
           "uncleared" (in particular matched principal) would be a closer alternative to
           LCH.Clearnet for LCH.Clearnet's customers than switching to ECAG, [BUSINESS
           SECRETS] is not convincing. [BUSINESS SECRETS].127 In addition, being an

           advantages as LSEG's CCPs (central position, netting possibilities, etc.) and is thus
           the most (and only) direct alternative to LSEG's CCPs in the CCP clearing of bonds
           space. It is appropriate to exclude that the Notifying Parties compete for cleared
           bonds or to conclude that going "uncleared" is a closer option for all market
           participants than switching to ECAG [BUSINESS SECRETS]. This is because, as
           explained in Section 6.2.2. above, a significant number of customers do not view
           cleared and uncleared bonds as substitutable and even customers that only clear part
           of their bond trades (and go uncleared for the rest), to the extent they want to clear,
           they would continue clearing even in the event of an increase in clearing fees.128

   (191)  Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that post-Transaction, the merged entity could
          consider implementing alternative strategies to maintain the clearing business
          [BUSINESS SECRETS]. Evidence of this possibility is shown, for example, in
          [BUSINESS SECRETS]137 This [BUSINESS SECRETS] shows that the merged
          entity could, for example, potentially offer [DESCRIPTION OF POTENTIAL
          STRATEGIES DERIVED FROM BUSINESS SECRETS].138
   (192)  In their response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties did not
          comment on [BUSINESS SECRETS] cited in the previous recital and did not
          comment on the possibility for [NOTIFYING PARTIES DESCRIPTION OF ECAG
          POSITIONING, CONTAINING BUSINESS SECRETS].
   (193)  It follows from the above considerations, that the impact of the decision of the
          [BUSINESS SECRETS] and its consequences on Eurex' position especially on the
          clearing market remain too uncertain to overcome the Commission's concerns with
          respect to the impact of the Transaction in relation to clearing of bonds.
   (194)  In any event and in view of the foregoing, the Commission considers that the
          [BUSINESS SECRETS] position of DBAG in the bonds clearing market
          ([BUSINESS SECRETS]) as well as any consideration on the extent to which the
          Notifying Parties closely compete for the clearing of bonds is not of particular
          relevance, since the Transaction eliminates the only relevant (and by definition
          closest) actual and potential competitor of LSEG in the market for CCP clearing of
          bonds. Through the elimination of the only competitive constraint currently exerted
          on LSEG and the creation of a de facto monopoly at clearing level, the Transaction
          would give the merged entity the ability to unilaterally increase prices for CCP
          cleared bonds, without risking a loss of volumes to other CCPs.
   (195)  The Commission finally considers that, contrary to the Notifying Parties' argument,
          customer sponsored entry in the bonds' clearing space of new CCPs or of CCPs that
          are active in neighbouring markets is unlikely.
   (196)  First, as already noted in Section 5.2.1. above, barriers to entry into financial
          infrastructure markets are high, due in particular to strong network effects and
          economies of scale and scope. In order to successfully enter the market, a new player
          would have to overcome high investments and high regulatory requirements, achieve
          low costs, position itself to offer innovative product offerings to challenge what
          existing CCPs are able to offer, and obtain the support of a sufficient number of
          market participants.
   (197)  These considerations also apply to bonds clearing. First, the market investigation did
          not yield any evidence or indications of a future entry or expansion from
          neighbouring markets.
   (198)  EuroCCP indicated that it is not considering entering the bonds clearing market. As
          explained by EuroCCP itself "EuroCCP does not clear fixed income (either repos or
          bonds) and is not considering to enter this area."139 EuroCCP further described the
          hurdles that CCP clearing equities would encounter in order to enter the fixed income
          space as follows: "It is not easy for a CCP not active in fixed income clearing to

             enter this market: first, it requires to obtain a specific EMIR authorisation; second,
             and most importantly, clearing is characterised by high network effects and high
             fixed costs which constitute barriers to entry for potential new players. It would need
             to develop an entirely new management system for fixed income which requires
             investments and would increase EuroCCPs fixed costs (e.g. by engaging additional
             employees). Since every CCP needs to have a critical mass to operate, the defection
             of only a few companies (in case they decided, e.g. to sponsor the entry of a new
             CCP) from a CCP would not be sufficient for a new entrant to be viable.
             Furthermore, sponsors will incur additional costs due to the continued requirement
             to use the first CCP when transacting with counterparties who have chosen not to
             leave; this is a disincentive for firms to sponsor a new CCP. In short, compared to
             starting to clear equity lending transaction, entering the fixed income clearing space
             (i.e. clearing of repos and bonds) would take significantly longer, entail much higher
             investments (in terms e.g. of risk management enhancement, validation, etc.) and
             increased fixed costs, while commercial barriers to entry are also much higher."140
   (199)     In addition, the market investigation did not yield any evidence that other players,
             including CME and ICE, would be considering or have any plans to enter the bonds
             clearing space.141
   6.3.1.3. Conclusion
   (200)     In view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the Transaction would lead
             to a significant impediment of effective competition through the strengthening of a
             dominant position and creation of a de facto monopoly in the market for CCP
             clearing of bonds in the EEA.
   7.        REPOS
   7.1.      Introduction and the Notifying Parties' activities
   7.1.1.    Introduction to the repo market
   (201)     Repurchase agreements ("repos") are financing transactions in which securities are
             used as collateral for borrowing cash, or cash is used as collateral for borrowing
             securities. In economic terms, a repo transaction is equivalent to a collateralised loan,
             but in contrast to such a transaction, the ownership of the "collateral" changes hands
             in a repo. At the end of the repo transaction, the specific or equivalent securities are
             returned to the original owner, the cash is repaid, and both counterparties are left
             with what they possessed originally (plus/minus interest).
   (202)     Repos are an important means of ensuring liquid (inter-bank) money and
             securities/bond markets.142 Counterparties in a repo transaction can therefore either
             be "cash-driven" or "securities driven". In a repo transaction, "sellers" (i.e. the
             securities providers) are cash-driven meaning they are in need of obtaining
             temporary cash while they have the ability to offer securities as collateral for that
             financing. "Buyers" (i.e. the securities takers) can be either cash-driven (i.e.

           Securities lending is an economically similar transaction to repos, though in practice more often entails
           the temporary exchange of securities (i.e. a security is borrowed with another security as collateral).
EN                                                        45                                                         EN

             interested to lend money safely against interest) or securities-driven (i.e. driven by
             the need to obtain temporary use of specific securities).
   (203)     Repos are differentiated by a number of parameters including the interest rate and the
             duration of the transaction. The security is initially "sold" at the current market price
             and "repurchased" at a pre-agreed price - the original sale price plus a previously
             agreed upon rate of interest applied (the so-called "repo rate"). The duration of a repo
             typically ranges from one day to three months, sometimes longer.
   7.1.1.1. Specific repos vs general repos
   (204)     Repos can be either specific or general. A "specific" is a repo having a particular
             security as underlying, i.e. the collateral provided is a specified security and cannot
             be substituted with similar collateral of equivalent creditworthiness. The
             counterparties to a repo trade can also agree a list (referred to as a "basket") of
             securities which are acceptable to the buyer and the seller, can then provide any
             security from that list. Such repos are known as general collateral or "GC" repos.
   7.1.1.2. Non-triparty repos vs triparty repos
   (205)     Repos can be bilateral (non-triparty) or triparty, depending on whether or not they
             entail the use of a triparty agent for collateral management services ("CMS"). As
             explained above, repos function like loans: upon completion of the transaction, the
             buyer of the securities is obliged to return specific or equivalent securities. The need
             for collateral management is triggered by the requirement to value and potentially
             substitute the collateral on an ongoing basis. This can be done in-house or by a third-
             party, namely a triparty agent.
   (206)     In a triparty repo, a triparty agent, usually an ICSD or a custodian143, holds the
             collateral in a single account (that contains securities of the buyer and seller) at an
             ICSD or a CSD144. The triparty agent ensures maintenance of the value, quality and
             performance of the collateral, which entails the substitution of securities if so needed.
   (207)     All triparty repos are GC repos, but not vice-versa (GC repos with narrow baskets are
             generally speaking non-triparty repos).
   7.1.1.3. Repos traded on ATS vs bilaterally
   (208)     Repos can be traded on automatic repo trading systems ("ATS"), or bilaterally,
             through voice brokers or directly.
   (209)     Regarding bilateral trading, the counterparties can either use telephones or electronic
             messaging systems to enter into a transaction without the involvement of a third
             party ("direct trading"), or rely on voice-brokers, who in turn use telephones and
             electronic messaging systems.145
   (210)     ATS are dedicated networks of interactive screens on which prices are displayed for
             various repos. Transactions can be executed and cleared, and settlement can be
   143
           Custodians or custodian banks provide settlement and custody services in quality of intermediaries (as
           opposed to CSDs or ICSDs where the security was issued which have a direct access to the securities),
           as well as collateral management services.

           automated trading systems.

   7.1.1.4. Cleared vs. non-cleared repos
   (211)    Repos can be cleared through a CCP or counterparties can decide to go uncleared.146
   7.1.2.   Notifying Parties' activities
   (212)    DBAG is active in (ATS) trading of triparty and non-triparty repos through Eurex
            Repo, which operates an ATS. All repos traded through Eurex Repo are cleared and
            have to be cleared through Eurex Clearing AG (or ECAG). ECAG does not provide
            repo clearing services for trades not executed on Eurex Repo.
   (213)    DBAG provides CMS, for its own triparty repo product GC Pooling through
            Clearstream Banking Frankfurt ("CBF") and Clearstream Banking Luxembourg
            ("CBL") (together "Clearstream").
   (214)    DBAG is also active in settlement of repos through Clearstream.
   (215)    LSEG operates an ATS, MTS, for trading of triparty and non-triparty repos. Repos
            traded on MTS can be cleared through either LCH.Clearnet (SA and Ltd) or CC&G.
            LSEG's clearing houses also provide repo clearing services to third parties, including
            for customers of third parties' ATS such as BrokerTec or Tullett Prebon. LSEG
            offers triparty repo products in the form of X-COM, Term £GC and most notably
            €GC Plus.
   (216)    CMS for €GC Plus and for Term £GC is provided by a third party provider,
            Euroclear, while LSEG's Monte Titoli provides CMS for X-COM. LSEG is also
            active in settlement of repos through Monte Titoli (the Italian CSD).
   7.2.     Market definition
   7.2.1.   Notifying Parties' view
   (217)    The Notifying Parties submit that a broad distinction should be observed between
            triparty repos (GC repos which involve outsourced CMS), on the one hand, and non-
            triparty repos (which do not involve outsourced CMS), on the other hand. For both
            triparty and non-triparty repos, the Notifying Parties propose to define markets for
            the trading and clearing/risk management layers. The Notifying Parties do not
            consider that further segmentations are appropriate.
   (218)    The Notifying Parties also indicate that the distinction between triparty repos and
            non-triparty repos is supported by the European Central Bank ("ECB") and the
            International Capital Market Association ("ICMA").
   (219)    According to the Notifying Parties, demand for non-triparty and triparty repos is
            asymmetric, for a number of reasons. First, demand-side substitutability would
            depend on the motivation of the counterparties: a securities-driven collateral taker
            could not replace a non-triparty repo with a triparty/GC repo, whereas cash-driven
            collateral takers and collateral providers might see both types of repos as alternatives.
            Moreover, without triparty functionality, substitution of collateral would be a time-
            consuming process, and customers are not able to replicate the fluid re-use of
            collateral provided by a triparty agent. Finally, in the event of a non-transitory

           See Section 5.1.2. above for introductory remarks on clearing.

            increase in fees or margin requirements, sellers with high quality collateral could opt
            to transact via a non-triparty repo, whereas sellers with lower quality collateral could
            not.
   7.2.1.1. Plausible segmentations of the non-triparty repo market
   (220)    Within the non-triparty repo market segment, the Notifying Parties propose to define
            separate markets for trading and "risk management".
   (221)    For the trading level, the Notifying Parties contemplate a distinction by trading
            method (ATS, voice-broker and direct trading). The Notifying Parties however argue
            that demand-side substitutability across these types of repo transactions means that
            segmenting the market along these lines would not be appropriate, as every ATS
            repo trade could be done through a voice broker or directly, though not necessarily
            vice-versa. The Notifying Parties also argue that market participants constantly
            benchmark trading costs on ATS against those incurred when trading bilaterally. In
            their response to the Statement of Objections, the Parties reiterate that it is incorrect
            to define separate markets depending on the means by which repos are traded.
   (222)    Further, the Notifying Parties submit that there is a separate market for "risk
            management" for repos, meaning there are two substitutable manners in which to
            manage counterparty risk, which are bilateral risk management (i.e. going
            uncleared), and clearing through a CCP. In this regard, the Notifying Parties submit
            that the benefits of clearing accrue in particular for two-way traders147, who can net
            their position by way of clearing through a CCP. One way traders would rarely use a
            CCP, and hence in principle manage their risk bilaterally. However, even two-way
            traders, predominately large banks, would, according to the Notifying Parties, switch
            to uncleared repo trading in the event of a 5-10% price increase in clearing fees.
   (223)    The Notifying Parties further argue that it is incorrect to conclude that ATS traded
            non-triparty repos compete in bundles, comprising also a clearing layer, as most non-
            triparty repos are not cleared by CCPs, and most ATS trading venues offer the choice
            to clear or go uncleared.
   7.2.1.2. Plausible segmentations of the triparty repo market
   (224)    As for the triparty repo market segment, the Notifying Parties, while submitting that
            triparty repos compete in bundles in different collateral management systems, that
            means comprising trading, "risk management"/clearing as well as CMS, propose
            defining separate markets for trading (without further segmentation), for risk
            management (without further segmentation), for CMS, considering that the definition
            of these three markets sufficiently approximates the competitive dynamics in this
            space.
   (225)    In their response to the Decision opening the proceedings, the Parties argue that it is
            not appropriate to distinguish between ATS traded (and CCP cleared) and bilaterally
            traded (triparty) repos. In the Notifying Parties' view, competition between different
            triparty repo products takes place predominately within a given collateral pool.
            Accordingly, the Notifying Parties' triparty products compete rather with bilaterally
            traded triparty repos than with each other, in particular due to the costs associated
   147
           Being a two-way trader means in essence trading multiple repos daily in which they act as seller and
           buyer, often as intermediaries between cash providers and cash takers.

             with moving collateral from one collateral pool to another, and because the triparty
             interoperability will not happen soon.
   (226)     In their response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties reiterate their
             view that bilaterally traded triparty repos belong to the same market as those traded
             on ATS.
   7.2.1.3. Geographic scope of repo markets
   (227)     The Notifying Parties submit that the geographic scope of the above repo markets is
             EEA-wide, or, alternatively, for triparty repos, global with the exclusion of the US.
   7.2.2.    The Commission's assessment
   (228)     The Commission has not previously considered repos in its decisions.
   (229)     In the Decision opening the proceedings, and in the Statement of Objections, the
             Commission considered that securities lending and repos belong to distinct relevant
             markets in view of lack of demand-side substitutability resulting from different
             purposes of use (raise cash in bond market vs borrow specific stock), different types
             of securities generally used (bonds vs equities), different impact on the balance sheet,
             different regulatory treatment and the fact that in securities lending, securities are
             mostly exchanged for securities, whereas in repos, cash is lent in exchange for
             securities.148 In their response to the Decision opening the proceedings the Notifying
             Parties did not contest this finding. Furthermore, the in-depth market investigation
             did not yield any evidence that would cast doubt on the Commission's preliminary
             findings as expressed in the Statement of Objections.149
   (230)     Second, a number of parameters are of particular relevance when defining relevant
             markets in relation to repos. Specifically, based on the different features with
             variables along three main axes, namely how repos are traded, how they are cleared,
             and how the collateral is managed, there are five main types of repo transactions
             which are commonly used in the EEA.150
             –      Triparty repos based on GC pools (for example GC Pooling, € GC Plus, etc.)
                    traded on ATS and CCP-cleared;
             –      "Traditional" triparty repos, i.e. repos based on GC baskets that are bilaterally
                    traded and not CCP-cleared;
             –      Non-triparty repos traded on ATS (and CCP-cleared);
             –      Non-triparty repos traded through voice brokers; and
             –      Non-triparty repos traded directly.
   7.2.2.1. In the repo markets, a non-triparty segment and a triparty segment can be
             distinguished
   (231)     As explained above, the key difference between a triparty and a non-triparty repo is
             that a triparty repo entails collateral management service provided by a triparty

           agent, who selects (and substitutes) securities from a pool of collateral to which s/he
           has access.
   (232)   This difference has important implications both for demand and supply-side
           substitutability across these two types of repos.
   (233)   First, and in line with the Notifying Parties' submission, in a triparty repo
           transaction151, both counterparties are cash driven, whereas in a non-triparty repo,
           one of the counterparties may be security driven.152 In other words, a non-triparty
           repo enables a trader to temporarily obtain a specific security of which s/he has need,
           a result that a triparty repo cannot guarantee. Thus, for a significant part of the non-
           triparty market – i.e. every trader looking to obtain a specific security –, triparty
           repos do not constitute a conceivable alternative.153
   (234)   Second, for a number of (cash-driven) market participants intending to raise or invest
           cash, triparty repos are clearly the preferred means of doing so, in particular for
           reasons of efficiency.154 For instance, one market participant pointed to
           counterparties "which exclusively conduct their cash lending activity through triparty
           repos rather than simple repos […] thanks to the intrinsic benefits of the instrument
           (ease of use, risk management and settlement outsourcing, collateral management
           conducted by the triparty agent)"155, whereas another explained that "the vast
           majority of our repos are settled and managed using a triparty agent. Operational
           efficiency is the main factor"156.
   (235)   Other market participants in the market investigation argued along the same lines,
           explaining for example that "for a cash investor the decision to trade depends
           primarily on the repo rate he can achieve taking into consideration the risk appetite.
           Some investors prefer triparty repos as it reduces the settlement burden for them.",
           or that for cash-driven repos, it is mostly the following types that are relevant:
           "Mainly broad general collateral (triparty and General Collateral Pooling). To a
           lesser extend narrow General Collateral (non-triparty). Specific repos are of minor
           importance".157
   (236)   The Commission also notes that deciding which repo instrument to use – triparty,
           specific non-triparty or narrow GC non-triparty, for cash driven repos, depends on
           many factors that are difficult to capture. For example, for a trader seeking to obtain
           funding by means of repoing out collateral, the type of collateral available as well as
           the risk-appetite of counterparties may play a decisive role in which type of repo is
           best suited for his/her needs. For example, one bank explains that this choice
           "depends on the Collateral. How much ISINs [different types of securities] we have
           and where we have the ISINs. Do we have a lot of ISINs we prefer triparty. If we
           have only a few ISINs and the price is better with non-triparty we prefer that".
   151
         The Commission notes that triparty repo, for practical purposes, appear to always be GC repos, whereas
         specific repos are normally non-triparty repos. See Replies to questionnaire Q1 "Sell-side customers",

             Another states that "high Quality (Government) collateral tends to be more non-tri-
             party and we have term financing for non-government collateral via tri-party".158
   (237)     It would thus appear that, for a market participant in a given situation (i.e. with a
             specific type of collateral to use, a particular financing or funding need), only a very
             limited degree of demand-side substitutability exists across non-triparty and triparty
             repos.
   (238)     From a supply-side substitutability point of view, the distinction is even more clear-
             cut. The inherent presence of a triparty agent providing CMS requires, in particular
             for those triparty repos that are traded on ATS and CCP cleared, and on which this
             Decision focuses, the combination of three distinct services (trading, clearing and
             CMS) into one single product. As will be further explained below in Section 7.3.2, it
             took the Notifying Parties, the only providers of such products in the EEA, several
             years to bring their products to the market. A repo trading platform (or clearing
             house, or CMS provider) not active in ATS traded CCP cleared triparty repos could
             thus not start supplying such a product without a significant investment in terms of
             money and time.159
   (239)     In view of the above, the Commission concludes for the purposes of the Decision
             that the Notifying Parties' submission, namely that triparty and non-triparty repos do
             not form part of the same market, is correct.
   (240)     In the following sections, the Commission will assess whether, within triparty and
             non-triparty repos, further distinctions have to be drawn, in particular as regards the
             trading method and whether or not the repos are cleared by a CCP.
   (241)     In this context, the Commission notes that the response of the Notifying Parties to the
             Statement of Objections alleges that the evidence the Commission obtained from
             market participants in particular as regards those distinctions should not apply to
             triparty repos, because the Commission "inappropriately mixes and confuses
             considerations" for these two types of repos.
   (242)     The Commission considers firstly, that in the course of the market investigation, it
             has intentionally refrained from imposing on market participants an existing market
             definition. As a result, most questions do not, for example, explicitly distinguish
             between triparty and non-triparty repos, but rather aim at determining which products
             or services are seen as substitutes and competitive constraints for those of the
             Notifying Parties. Second, as regards the Commission's analysis, a distinction
             between triparty and non-triparty repos is drawn where the evidence suggests that it
             is appropriate to draw such a distinction.
   7.2.2.2. Repos traded on ATS do not form part of the same product market with repos traded
             bilaterally
   (243)     In the Decision opening the proceedings, and in the Statement of Objections, the
             Commission preliminarily found that ATS traded repos and repos traded bilaterally –
             directly between counterparts or via a voice broker – do not form part of the same
             product market.

   (244)     The Notifying Parties contest this finding in their response to the Decision opening
             the proceedings, and their response to the Statement of Objections, in particular by
             arguing that the relevant market should also comprise bilaterally traded repos, which
             are used interchangeably for the same purposes by market participants. The
             Commission will hence in particular assess the substitutability of ATS and bilaterally
             traded repos in the following sections.
   7.2.2.2.1. Trading on ATS differs in many other aspects from bilateral trading
   (245)     Aside from liquidity which appears to be the most important driver for trading
             behaviour, market participants consider a range of parameters in deciding on the
             trading environment (ATS versus bilateral) for a given repo contract, including the
             contract term, whether they intend to clear it through a CCP, settlement, posting of
             margin, counterparty type and netting possibilities.160
   (246)     Based on the results of the market investigation, there are a number of important
             distinguishing factors affecting the demand-side substitutability between ATS traded
             and bilaterally traded repos.
   (247)     First, a clear majority of respondents stated that trading fees on ATS are lower than
             those for voice brokers (though higher than for direct trades, given that there is no
             intermediary).161
   (248)     Second, both in terms of speed as well as in terms of certainty of execution, ATS rate
             considerably better than alternative forms of repo trading. In addition, ATS offer, as
             one market participant explain "highly efficient Straight Through Processing (STP)
             which is not or only to a lesser exten[t] available in the bilateral or voice broking
             markets."162
   (249)     Evidence gathered by the Commission indicates that the highly efficient manner in
             which ATS enable trading of repos is set to become even more important going
             forward. For instance, [BUSINESS SECRETS].163
   (250)     Third, a considerable share of respondents does not consider it possible to centrally
             clear directly traded repos, and indicate that the possibility to centrally clear voice-
             brokered repos is limited.164 As will be discussed in greater detail discussed in
             Section 7.2.2.3, the ability to submit a repo trade for central clearing appears to be of
             high importance to certain market participants.

           did not. Moreover, Intesa SanPaolo states in its reply to questionnaire Q11 "Sell-side Customers and
           issuers", question 90, that "costs on ATS are lower than those charged by brokers".

   (251)   In general, the key driver for repo traders is liquidity, and, to a somewhat lesser
           extent, the cost of trading.165 For example, one market participant explained that "the
           main parameter on which basis UCB selects the environment for trading is
           liquidity".166
   (252)   In terms of liquidity, the results of the market investigation provide clear indications
           that for certain types of repo contracts most of the liquidity has accumulated on ATS
           platforms. Generally, this is the case for repo contracts exhibiting two main
           characteristics, namely short maturities, and high quality liquid assets as underlying
           collateral ("HQLA").167
   (253)   As for the maturity, one market participant explains for example that "actually,
           markets are split in buckets: Short Term maturities are largely traded on ATS and
           Long Term maturities are more easily traded otherwise (voice broker or directly)".168
           Another market participant confirms this characterisation of the market by stating
           that "trading on ATS is preferred on very short term maturities as ATS can offer
           higher liquidity than OTC market. On longer term maturities most of the liquidity is
           OTC or via voice brokers".169 When asked to compare the different repo trade
           execution environment based on a list of parameters, a large majority of respondents
           also indicates that ATS, in particular for short term trades, offer the most liquidity
           and the narrowest bid-ask spreads. For example, one market participant explains that
           "ATS repo liquidity is centered on very short dated transactions of 1day. Voice
           brokers and bilateral transactions are typically much longer tenors of >1wk to
           1yr."170 In this context the largest ATS operator in repos, BrokerTec, indicates that
           98% of the repos traded on its platform have duration of one day only.171 Given that
           liquidity (and not fees) is the main driver in selection of the trading environment, it is
           unlikely that customers would switch the trading environment in response to a 5-10%
           fee increase.
   (254)   Against this background, the Commission does not consider the argument of the
           Notifying Parties submitted in the response to the Statement of Objections, namely
           that data from Eurex Repo indicates that most of the repos traded on this platform
           have a duration of [BUSINESS SECRET], and that therefore repos of all maturities
           are traded on ATS, to be convincing. First, only [SMALL AMOUNT] of ATS traded
           repos are concluded on Eurex Repo, and the Notifying Parties have not submitted
           any data for MTS, while it would in practice have a much larger market share. In that
           context, the Commission notes that in a submission of 21 February 2017, the
           Notifying Parties appear to contradict their earlier submission, when explaining that

           "the majority of non-triparty repos […] are short term, and [BUSINESS
           SECRET]".172
   (255)   Second, even those figures suggest that a large majority of repos traded on Eurex
           Repo have a duration of [BUSINESS SECRET]. Third, the feedback from market
           participants – (larger) competitors and almost all customers – has been particularly
           unambiguous, indicating a strong preference to trade short-term repos on ATS. For
           example, one large bank indicated that it would "only trade outside ATS for longer
           terms"173.
   (256)   Aside from maturity, the type of collateral that underlies a repo trade also appears to
           be an important factor for determining whether a repo would be traded on ATS or
           bilaterally. When asked about the parameters considered when making this choice,
           one market participant explained that the number one factor is "collateral. Primarily
           HQLA paper (especially: Governments and Supranational can be traded on an ATS).
           Other collateral needs to be traded bilaterally […].174"
   (257)   Conversely, repos based on other types of collateral, in particular equities or
           corporate bonds, are rarely traded on ATS.175
   (258)   Similarly to other financial instruments, the building up of liquidity on ATS is
           facilitated by one inherent element of electronic trading – the standardisation of
           contracts. The liquidity has in turn a direct consequence on the bid-ask spread which
           is narrowing, pulling further liquidity on to ATS. Liquidity also appears to be an
           important consideration for customers deciding between ATS traded and
           "traditional" triparty repos. For example, one large bank explains that "there is a high
           degree of liquidity in GC pools via e-trading platform which might not exist in the
           bilateral ‘traditional’ triparty market", whereas another states that "we deem
           traditional triparty repos suitable for non-liquid/non-Government collateral baskets,
           while triparty GC pools would be preferable for liquid collateral within standard
           baskets (better pricing on ATS’s, no counterparty risk)."176
   (259)   In their response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties submit that the
           Commission has ignored the fact that many repos traded bilaterally are also based on
           HQLA. The reason for this is not, in the Commission's view, that, as the Notifying
           Parties suggest, bilateral and ATS trading of repos form part of the same market, but
           that those market participants not trading repos on ATS, such as in particular buy-
           side customers, use other repo trading methods including when they trade repos
           based on HQLA, as discussed in Section 7.2.2.2.3. In contrast to these D2C
           transactions, D2D repo transactions based on HQLA are performed on ATS to a very
           large degree.177

   (260)    Therefore, and in line with the Notifying Parties' submission in the Form CO, the
            Commission considers that ATS trading is pre-dominantly used for short-term,
            standard transactions in highly liquid assets, in particular for government bonds. As
            most of the liquidity for these repo contracts is on ATS, the results of the market
            investigation indicate that other means of trading are currently considered to be
            inferior, given the importance of liquidity as a determinant for the choice of
            execution environment.
   7.2.2.2.3. The ATS repo markets are currently in essence D2D markets
   (261)    In the Decision opening the proceedings and the Statement of Objections, the
            Commission preliminarily considered that ATS trading of repos is currently done
            almost exclusively by large banks/dealers trading with each other ("D2D").
   (262)    The Notifying Parties contest this finding in their response to the Decision opening
            the proceedings with respect to triparty repos. However, it did not submit any
            arguments pertaining to non-triparty repos.
   (263)    The Commission notes that while the question as to whether the market(s) for ATS
            traded repos are in essence limited to a particular group of customers (D2D) is an
            important element in defining the relevant market, it is not, as such, in itself decisive.
            Nonetheless, the fact that almost exclusively D2D repo transactions are traded on
            ATS provides a further indication for the existence of separate markets for ATS and
            bilaterally traded repos.
   (264)    The results of the in-depth market investigation confirm that, generally speaking,
            ATS trading remains mostly limited to D2D transactions. A large majority of
            respondents indicate that their counterparties on ATS are exclusively other banks and
            dealers, and of those that are large banks, only two indicate that they also encounter
            other types of customers.178 One market participant, a large dealer, explained for
            example that "ATS is the domain of the inter dealer market for repos. […] Client
            trades are generally manual i.e. via Sales and over the phone."179 Another, medium-
            sized dealer confirmed that "D2D transactions are essentially executed via ATS or
            voice broking. Transactions with clients are essentially executed by voice
            directly"180, whereas a smaller dealer stated that "we do not trade through voice
            trading or direct trading with other [interdealer] market participants; so we trade
            outside ATS only and marginally, when we trade with our clients".181 Finally, this
            finding is also consistent with a report by the ECB pertaining to the secured funding
            market for banks, which states that "the bulk of repos traded in European markets
            are negotiated and executed on automatic trading systems (ATS)".182
   (265)    This does not mean that D2D repos exclusively take place on ATS. Dealers also use
            bilateral trading of repos, including in particular voice-trading through brokers, in a
            complementary way in a different set of circumstances. Indeed, the results of the
            market investigation indicate that dealers do bilateral trading for longer-term, larger

           or more complex transactions, often based on less liquid collateral.183 In this context
           a large dealer explained that "voice brokers are used for more bespoke trading
           requirements when the underlying is less liquid".184 For these types of customers,
           trading repos on ATS and via voice brokers therefore seems to be complementary,
           rather than substitutable. For LSEG (LCH) itself, in its role as a repo user, one of its
           internal documents suggests that this complementarity between repo trading methods
           was a driver for it to seek access to an ATS: [BUSINESS SECRETS]185
   (266)   Similarly, the above is not inconsistent with the fact that a large share of repo traders
           does not seem to use ATS at all. One of the non-bank respondents to the market
           investigation explained that they traded "no ATS, always directly with a counterparty
           (via email or phone)"186, another simply stated "No trading on ATS".187 This,
           according to the market investigation, seems to concern in particular buy-side
           customers such as asset managers or insurance companies. A large majority of those
           types of customers that responded to the market investigation confirmed that they
           trade repos only bilaterally.188
   (267)   Finally, the largest ATS, BrokerTec describes itself as "a Bank to Bank platform
           (B2B). Membership of LCH Repoclear facility is required in order to trade on
           BrokerTec. Therefore currently only first and second tier banks (60-65) trade on
           BrokerTec as per the definitions of membership at LCH".189
   (268)   As for the Notifying Parties' argument pertaining to triparty repos, namely that no
           clear D2D versus D2C distinction can be drawn in this respect, the results of the
           market investigation do not support the Notifying Parties' position.
   (269)   When asked to identify relevant differences between ATS and bilaterally traded
           triparty repos, respondents to the market investigation indicate that ATS traded
           triparty products are used essentially only in the D2D space.190 One market
           participant for example explained that "ATS Tri-party (EUREX GC POOLING) is
           cleared by CCP with predefined baskets controlled/governed by Eurex clearing.
           […]. Only banks are eligible on the CCP".191 Similarly, another large bank explains
           that for "For GC Pooling you must be a member of Eurex clearing to trade. Outside
           of that we trade a range of complexity and counterparties but the trades are not
           cleared."192

   (270)   It follows from those statements of banks that they consider the Notifying Parties'
           ATS traded triparty repos as D2D products, whereas "traditional", bilateral triparty
           repos are seen as a complementary product, as another large bank explains: "The
           majority of our tri-party repo is executed on a bi-lateral basis. Most tri-party is
           client cash driven and collateral is extremely conservative. The majority is non intra-
           bank. ATS will be used for firm financing where the collateral baskets meet our firm
           financing needs."193
   (271)   The Notifying Parties' submission in response to the Decision opening the
           proceedings aimed at demonstrating that numerous initiatives are underway to bring
           buy-side clients, who as explained below, currently trade predominately bilaterally,
           on ATS for (triparty) repo trading, would, against this background, rather have to be
           considered as an attempt to enter a new market, than to expand an existing market.
   (272)   First, [BUSINESS SECRETS]

           SECRETS] ,[BUSINESS SECRETS] . Similarly, in the specialist press, the
           prediction was shared that "Elixium will most likely rival DBV-X, which also aims to
           match treasurers and asset managers with hedge funds and pension funds in need of
           short-term financing"196.
   (274)   Moreover, also LSEG's internal documents explain that the [BUSINESS
           SECRETS]197 As will be explained below in Section 7.2.2.3., essentially all repos
           traded on ATS are cleared, and hence the reference to the currently uncleared buy-
           side market means that D2C transactions do not occur on ATS to a relevant degree.
   (275)   Second, DBAG itself describes its GC Pooling Select product in its internal
           document [BUSINESS SECRETS]198 [BUSINESS SECRETS]
   (276)   In their response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties argue that
           these new products are signs of a gradual shift towards a combined D2C/D2D
           market. The Commission notes that the Notifying Parties thereby appear to
           acknowledge that presently, the market(s) for ATS traded repos are separate.
   (277)   In any event, even if it were correct to qualify DBAG's attempt [BUSINESS
           SECRETS], the Commission does not consider the fact that Eurex' triparty ATS D2C
           product, GC Pooling Select, [BUSINESS SECRETS], as sufficiently compelling
           evidence for the Commission to alter its overall characterisation of ATS trading of
           repos as being, in essence, a D2D domain.
   (278)   Third, only a very small share of market participants indicated in the Commission's
           market investigation that they would engage in ATS traded triparty repos with non-
           dealers.199

   (279)     Therefore, while it cannot be disputed that Eurex, and in fact also LCH, are
             attempting to win buy-side clients as ATS (and/or CCP members), this development
             appears to be in a nascent state. Moreover, the fact that DBAG considered it
             necessary to design a specific product targeting these non-bank clients would also
             appear to show that it is correct to draw a broad D2D versus D2C distinction along
             these lines.
   (280)     In view of the above, the Commission considers that, at least at this point in time,
             ATS trading of repos, for non-triparty and triparty repos alike, remains to a very
             large degree dominated by D2D trades.
   7.2.2.2.4. Market participants would not switch to bilateral trading
   (281)     Contrary to the Notifying Parties' submissions in response to the Decision opening
             the proceedings and to the Statement of Objections, the results of the market
             investigation suggest that a majority of respondents do not systematically compare
             execution costs on ATS with those of other forms of trading repos. From those that
             can be characterised as large customers (and hence account for the lion's share of
             ATS volumes), only very few respondents indicated that they would make such a
             comparison.200
   (282)     One market participant explained for example that "execution costs are a
             consideration but no cost comparison systematically occurs. Trading options are
             dictated by availability of liquidity."201
   (283)     The lack or at most very limited competitive interaction between ATS and voice
             brokered trading of repos is also illustrated by the fact that the largest ATS –
             BrokerTec – indicates that it does not monitor fees charged by voice broker firms,
             and that it has its own voice brokerage service to satisfy a different type of customer
             need, namely for bespoke transactions.202
   (284)     As for the reaction of ATS customers to a small but significant and non-transitory
             increase of price (or SSNIP), the results of the market investigation suggest that few,
             if any customers would switch. First, as explained in the foregoing, liquidity is the
             main determinant for trading choices.
   (285)     Therefore, market participants would appear to only consider a switch from ATS
             platform to voice brokers for reasons of liquidity.203
   (286)     In view of the results of the market investigation, it would appear to be very unlikely
             that a SSNIP (in fees) could induce such a shift of liquidity. First, there seem to be a

           Agreed minutes of a call with ICAP of 15 November 2016, [ID 6038]: "ATS trading and voice broker
           trading for repos are substantially different solutions. Electronic trading is used for the most regular,
           standardised transactions such as "spot next" (or 1-day) transactions. It provides a straight and
           transparent execution mode with a tight bid-offer spread. Voice brokerage is for bespoke transactions
           requiring typically an element of price discovery before execution. Moreover, fee levels in electronic
           are not based off a comparison with what voice offers and more generally what it costs for a customer
           to execute a trade on ATSs. These businesses are run and managed separately."

           number of market participants that always prefer to trade on ATS.204 The liquidity of
           these market participants would hence appear to be particularly tied to ATS. Second,
           fees on ATS seem to be so much lower than those for voice brokers205 that a 5-10%
           increase in trading fees on ATS is unlikely to make voice brokers more attractive in
           that regard. Third, only a very small minority of respondents to the market
           investigation could recall an increase in trading fees in the recent past and only one
           provided a meaningful response as to their reaction then. This market participant
           referred to an event where "fees […] increased from 50 to 100 euros for 2 weeks -3
           months trades and from 50 to 150 Euros for longer period trades." Their reaction
           was that "we acknowledged the increase but we continue to use the ATS for liquidity
           reasons".206
   (287)   In view of the above, to the extent that liquidity is currently accumulated on ATS
           platforms for certain repo types, it can be inferred that customers would only switch
           to other repo trading methods for those types of repos that are currently traded
           predominately on ATS in the event that most customers did so, more or less
           simultaneously, so that liquidity would become larger elsewhere.
   (288)   In the response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties submit that the
           Commission's assessment has largely ignored direct repo trading. The Commission
           notes firstly that the Notifying Parties have argued that voice brokerage is a
           particularly important constraint on ATS platforms in their response to the Decision
           opening the proceedings. More importantly, however, most of the Commission's
           assessment described above pertains to both forms of bilateral trading, direct and
           voice-brokered.
   (289)   Further, the Notifying Parties submit in response to the Statement of Objections that
           bilateral repo trading accounts for approximately two thirds of all repo trades.
           However, as explained throughout this section on market definition, there are clear
           indications that a large part of these trades are performed by different types of
           customers (particularly D2C transactions), based on different types of underlying (for
           example equities or corporate bonds), or consist of complex, long-term transactions.
           In the Commission's view, the fact that there is a larger repo space has as such no
           decisive bearing on the defining relevant markets for the purposes of merger control.
   (290)   At least in the current market environment, bilaterally traded and ATS traded repos
           are therefore not to be regarded as substitutes.
   (291)   Therefore, the Commission concludes that, for the purposes of the Decision, that
           ATS trading of repos does not form part of the same product market as bilateral
           trading.

   7.2.2.3. Centrally cleared repos and uncleared repos are not part of the same product market
   (292)     In its Decision opening the proceedings and in the Statement of Objections, the
             Commission preliminarily found that, in particular for repos traded on ATS, centrally
             cleared repos and those with bilateral "risk management" ("uncleared repos") do not
             form part of the same product market.
   (293)     The Notifying Parties contest this finding in their response to the Decision opening
             the proceedings and in their response to the Statement of objections, arguing in
             essence that all ATS except for DBAG's Eurex Repo allow traders to go uncleared
             [BUSINESS SECRETS] and that a majority of all repo volumes remain uncleared.
   (294)     Section 7.2.2.3. assesses whether a general distinction should be drawn between
             uncleared and cleared repos. Sections 7.2.2.4 and 7.2.2.5 will specifically focus on
             the ATS repo markets.
   7.2.2.3.1. Some types of repos cannot be cleared by a CCP
   (295)     Today, approximately 30% of outstanding repos by value and 70% by turnover are
             centrally cleared in Europe.207 This discrepancy between turnover and outstanding
             value is indicative of the fact that different types of repos tend to be cleared than
             those that are mainly uncleared. As will be explained throughout the remainder of
             this Section 7.2.2 on market definition, there is strong correlation between the repos
             traded on ATS and those that are centrally cleared: ATS traded (non-triparty) repos
             are mostly based on HQLA and, importantly, of short duration. Those repos are
             almost always cleared, as explained below, whereas repos with a longer maturity are
             often not cleared. The difference between outstanding value and turnover illustrates
             this difference.
   (296)     In addition to maturity, there are two main elements that explain why a significant
             part of repo trades is not cleared: either because counterparties are not clearing
             members208, or because the CCPs do not accept to clear repos based on a given type
             of collateral.
   (297)     As regards the first element, the results of the market investigation indicate that it is
             not possible to clear repos traded with certain (non-bank) counterparties. When asked
             what types of repos were generally not cleared, market participants explained that
             these were "trades where the counterparties are not members (client driven trades)",
             "repos with non-financial customers", "client business", client trades", repo trades
             with non-broker/Dealer".209
   (298)     Regarding the collateral underlying the repo, the results of the market investigation
             indicate that there are restrictions on the eligibility of collateral from the side of the
             CCP, based on their acceptable risk profile ("repo vs collateral not eligible on the
             ATS (RMBS etc.)"210). For example, repos based on Greek governments bonds seem

            not to be accepted for clearing.211 Second for some types of collateral, clearing has
            simply not become commonplace (possibly due to high margin requirements for
            "riskier" collateral) or due to some regional exceptions – for example, the
            Scandinavian and Spanish bonds seem to be not systematically cleared, if at all.212
            For example, one large Spanish bank explained that it did not clear repos "with
            domestic counterparties and Spanish paper as underlying"213.
   (299)    More generally speaking, market participants explained that "repo trades against
            non-government debt are typically not centrally cleared"214, and long term repos are
            not cleared ("Long term" (>1yr for LCH ; >2yrs for EUREX"215)). Others identified
            equities as a type of repo collateral generally not cleared ("Equity repo trades are not
            centrally cleared, generally speaking"216), or simply referred to "bonds [that] are not
            covered by a clearing service"217.
   (300)    The above considerations pertain predominately to non-triparty repos.
   (301)    Finally, with specific regard to triparty repos, one market participant explains that
            most triparty repos are not centrally cleared, explaining that "Triparty repo – vast
            majority is not centrally cleared (exception is GC pooling basket, € GC plus
            service)".218 This is confirmed by the largest ATS on the market, explaining that "the
            reason that fewer tri-party repos are cleared is that CCPs do not accept all qualities
            of collateral (and counterparties). In fact, few CCPs accept any other collateral than
            government bonds for repos – therefore the only specific Tri-party products that can
            be cleared are DBV and €uroGC+ […] also GC Pooling."219.
   (302)    Therefore, it seems that there is a distinct group of repos which are not cleared based
            on their intrinsic characteristics, predominately the underlying collateral, their
            maturity and the counterparties to the trade.
   (303)    In sum, the results of the market investigation indicate that in essence the same type
            of repo transactions that tend to be traded on ATS (in particular short term HQLA)
            by sell-side customers are also cleared (this is further discussed below in Sections
            7.2.2.4. and 7.2.2.5.).
   7.2.2.3.2. CCP clearing of repos brings a number of benefits, in particular for frequent users
   (304)    For dealers which trade large repo volumes, involving a CCP enables them primarily
            to benefit from netting effects, reduce the size of their balance sheet and incur lower
            capital costs, in addition to reducing counterparty risk.220 This seems to be confirmed
            by DBAG's internal documents explaining that there is a general drive towards CCP
            clearing for banks as "new regulatory environment significantly impacts banks’
            funding and financing strategy; further reduction of balance sheets required.

           Therefore, banks increasingly looking for infrastructures to allow netting
           opportunities as well as capital, collateral and cost efficiencies".221
   (305)   That these elements are important factors contributing to the attractiveness of
           clearing is summarised by one market participant that explains that "when the deal is
           cleared the Bank can benefit from a number of positive contributions to the balance
           sheet. In particular, you may consider the reduction in capital charges associated to
           a generally reduced credit/counterparty risk as well as, in general, a reduction in the
           collateral posted by the CCP (if compared to that posted by bilateral counterparties),
           thereby improving the comprehensive liquidity degree of the balance sheet."222
   (306)   The key drivers for repos to be cleared by a CCP seem to be netting,223 and balance
           sheet netting.224 The results of the market investigation indicate that, compared to
           other instruments, in repos this plays a more prominent role than for example
           counterparty risk, as the risk is largely collateralised with the security exchanged in
           repo transactions.
   (307)   The importance of these two types of netting was highlighted by a large number of
           market participants.225 One explained, for example, that "trades cleared over CCPs
           are eligible for netting and therefore have a smaller impact on balance sheet".226
   (308)   This seems in particular important for frequent, or as the Notifying Parties submit
           two-way traders, comprising in particular large banks or dealers that engage in many
           repo transactions. As one market participant explains "as most inter-bank trades are
           centrally cleared this results in greater balance sheet netting possibilities as the CCP
           is viewed as one counterparty".227 Finally, another large bank explained that "cleared
           repos are allowed […] to be netted down for each CCP as long as certain conditions
           are met viz. currency and maturity date. A similar ability to net for bilateral
           counterparts is very limited. This is a major advantage of clearing repos as it
           considerably reduces balance sheet impact for the firm."228
   (309)   In response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties submit that under
           certain circumstances, it might also be possible to obtain similar benefits through
           bilateral netting, and refer to a statement of a bank which explains that direct trading
           may be preferred where there would be a netting advantage with the same
           counterparty. The Notifying Parties omit, however, that this is the only instance in
           the market investigation in which a market participant mentioned bilateral netting,

         The CCP will net transactions between members on a multilateral basis. This means that a delivery of a
         security due to the CCP from parties A and B can be netted off against deliveries of the same security
         due on the same day from the CCP to parties C and D. This produces much smaller net exposures than
         bilateral     netting,    and      hence     also     considerably       lower     settlement.     See

          that the same bank also explained that, regarding CCP clearing of repos, "a similar
          ability to net for bilateral counterparts is very limited"229, and most importantly, that
          when asked to explain the differences between uncleared and cleared repos, 17 out of
          20 informative responses entail an emphasis of netting as a key feature of CCP
          clearing of repos230.
   (310)  Further, in the Form RM231, the Notifying Parties explain that through the
          implementation of T2S (see also below in Section 11.2.2.2.), balance sheet netting
          will become an even more important factor (for euro denominated repos), and even
          outweigh liquidity as the key driver for the choice of trading/clearing venue. To this
          end, [BUSINESS SECRETS]
   (311)  While customers did not fully share the Notifying Parties' view that balance sheet
          netting would be or become more important than liquidity232, they also emphasise the
          significance of savings that can be obtained233.
   (312)  None of these savings can be realised without clearing through a CCP.
   (313)  In addition to the above, there are a number of other factors that, for repo trading,
          make central clearing attractive as compared to going uncleared.
   (314)  First, and related to the above, clearing a repo through a CCP can reduce the risk-
          weight of this balance sheet item. As one market participant explains, clearing
          achieves a "reduction in regulatory risk capital".234
   (315)  Second, for a number of market participants, the decrease in counterparty risk also
          seems to be an important factor in deciding whether or not to clear a repo, even if, as
          explained, this seems to be a less relevant factor than netting possibilities.235
   (316)  Third, for some market participants CCP clearing may even entail posting less
          margin with the CCP than they would have to with their bilateral counterparties.236
   (317)  Fourth, the overall reduction of the size of the balance sheet that can be achieved
          through clearing of repos, has, according to one market participant "knock-on, second
          order effect for annual regulatory charges such as the Single Resolution Funds, UK
          Levy and so on"237. This statement illustrates that clearing, as compared to going
          uncleared, has effects that go beyond the costs and benefits of a single trade. Many
          banks in the current environment in which capital is expensive and scarce would thus
          likely need considerable efforts to keep their balance sheets as small as possible.
   (318)  In view of the above, the Commission considers that from the perspective of a
          customer, in particular those that trade repos frequently, such as large banks and
          dealers, clearing repos through a CCP has a multitude of different effects and
          distinguishing elements as compared to going uncleared. As a result, cleared and

             uncleared repos have both their own reasons for existence and seem to cater for
             different portions of demand.
   7.2.2.3.3. For CCP cleared repos, going uncleared is not a substitute for most customers
   (319)     In response to the Decision opening the proceedings and to the Statement of
             Objections, the Notifying Parties reiterate their argument that central clearing and
             going uncleared form part of an overall "risk management market".
   (320)     The Commission acknowledges that an abstract question as to the general
             substitutability between cleared and uncleared repos has not yielded conclusive
             answers (approximately half of the respondents indicated that they were substitutes,
             whereas the other half did not).238 In view of the overall results of the market
             investigation, as explained in this section, the Commission does not consider this as
             decisive for the purposes of defining the relevant market. Nor does the Commission
             consider the fact that a number of market participants239 confirm the Notifying
             Parties' submission that in response to a drastic increase in margin requirements for
             clearing certain repos in CCPs, there seems to have been in the past a limited shift of
             activity to the uncleared market, as a particularly strong in argument in favour of an
             overall market for "repo risk management.
   (321)     Similarly, while a certain degree of competitive interaction may exist between the
             cleared and uncleared repo space – for example one large bank explained that
             "significant dislocations between cleared margin and bilateral haircuts could
             potentially lead to a re-evaluation of clearing behaviour"240,– this does not put into
             question the fundamental economics of repo clearing as opposed to uncleared repo
             transactions.
   (322)     One first reason to consider CCP cleared repos to form part of different markets from
             uncleared repos is the fact that a majority of respondents to the market investigation
             do not systematically compare the options of clearing and going uncleared for a
             given repo trade.241
   (323)     Aside from the intrinsic benefits of clearing repos as described above, the key reason
             for this appears to be again liquidity: given that most market participants trade on
             ATS and clear short-term HQLA repos, liquidity accumulates in cleared repos (for
             those types of collateral). In other words and as further explained below, even on
             those ATS that enable going uncleared, the same offer will not be available in a
             cleared and uncleared "version". As one market participant explains, "basically we
             choose trading through CCP since […] it is the preferred option by counterparties
             [and therefore] market depth is higher".242

   (324)   It thus is logical that most market participants that would consider switching from
           cleared to uncleared repos would appear to do so only for reasons of liquidity.243
   (325)   In view of the results of the market investigation, it would appear to be very unlikely
           that a SSNIP (in clearing fees) could induce such a shift of liquidity. This is also the
           case because there seem to be a number of market participants that always prefer
           clearing. For example, one large dealer indicated that "the firm chooses to clear
           where the trading activity is clearing eligible",244 whereas another market participant
           explained "we have a preference for centrally cleared repos and our experience is
           that the Banks who are our counterparties have the same preference".245
   (326)   Moreover, while only a few respondents to the market investigation report on the
           existence of internal guidelines for themselves that would not allow them to go
           uncleared,246 a considerable number of market participants including some large
           dealers but also smaller players confirm that there are counterparties that would not
           agree to trade a repo with them without the involvement of a CCP.247 One market
           participant states that "Yes, [X] has experienced in the past that repo counterparties
           are seeking to clear repo activity due to internal counterparty credit limit
           constraints".248 Another market participant explains that "we are aware of
           counterparties who only wish to trade via CCP for capital and netting reasons,
           regardless of the credit standing of counterparties."249 The liquidity from those
           customers would hence appear to be particularly tied to CCPs.
   (327)   Furthermore, one market participant illustrates the potential quantitative advantages
           of clearing as follows: "Due to the netting benefit as described above, the balance
           sheet and liquidity ratio of a centrally cleared repo are substantially reduced. By
           way of example: - 100million Uncleared repo: balance sheet impact is 100million,
           leverage exposure is 100 million; - 100million Cleared repo: balance sheet impact is
           zero, leverage exposure is zero except for haircut element".250 This indicates that, in
           a given situation, the difference in the overall costs between having a repo cleared or
           not can potentially be substantial.
   (328)   Finally, when asked about how they would react to a SSNIP (in clearing fees), only a
           small percentage of respondents indicated that they would switch to uncleared trades
           in such an event. A much larger share of respondents would instead continue to rely
           on (the Notifying Parties') clearing services and absorb the price increase.251
   (329)   In response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties submitted that given
           low or even non-existent marginal costs for clearing, even a small share of customers
           switching to other forms of clearing would amount to a critical loss that makes a
           hypothetical price increase unprofitable. Given the dynamics as described above, the
           Commission considers it highly unlikely that a SSNIP would lead to a critical loss.

   (330)    One of the reasons given as part of the responses to the market investigation for the
            preference to absorb fee increases rather than move to uncleared repos is that those
            participants who clear repos on CCPs can usually pass on fee increases to their
            customers. For example, one large bank explained that "LCH Ltd has increased its
            costs on several occasions, to offset cost induced by regulatory changes. These
            increases were translated in the clients prices connected to the clearing activity",252
            whereas another bank stated that "clearing costs are generally accepted and passed
            to the customer"253.
   (331)    Indeed, one bank explained that "short dated repo will remain cleared by a CCP.
            Switching back to uncleared trading is not possible taking the administrative burden
            (booking of tickets, checking confirmations, physical settlement of gross exposure)
            into consideration".254
   (332)    Against this background, it is highly unlikely that a 5-10% increase in clearing fees
            would bring about a switch of sufficient volume that would put, for those types of
            repos currently cleared, clearing on an equal footing with going uncleared.
   (333)    LSEG's internal documents, as shown below, support this definition of de-facto
            dealer-to-dealer (or interbank) repo market(s), which to a large extent consist of
            cleared repos (traded predominately on ATS), whereas the remainder of the market
            (for buy-side repos) is largely reliant on bilateral, uncleared repo trading.
   Figure 3: [GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATION OF THE EUROPEAN FIXED INCOME REPO
   MARKET]
   (334)    The uncleared interbank repo market, on the other hand, would appear to be
            comparatively small (around [20-30%] of the total interbank market) and mostly
            pertain, as this slide and the results of the market investigation indicate, to all those
            repos that for various reasons cannot or are not traded on ATS (and are not cleared
            by CCP): larger and/or more complex deals (which are then traded via voice
            brokers), repos based on collateral that CCPs would not accept for clearing (or only
            against high margin), such as corporate bonds, some "domestic" transactions and
            repos concluded outside CCP opening hours, and repos between counterparties that
            are not clearing members.255
   (335)    In their response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties submit that, as
            regards triparty repos, [BUSINESS SECRETS], and should therefore be considered
            as forming part of the same market. Moreover, it submitted that [BUSINESS
            SECRETS]
   (336)    The Commission does not contest this, but notes that the Notifying Parties have not
            provided any indications as to whether the uncleared volumes are based on D2D or
            D2C transactions. Given the above figures, the Commission considers it highly likely
            that most of these uncleared triparty repos are traded with (buy-side) counterparties
            not active on GC Pooling.

   (337)     In view of all of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that CCP cleared repos
             and uncleared repos do not form part of the same product market.256
   7.2.2.4. ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos compete in bundles
   (338)     The Notifying Parties submit that "triparty repo products effectively compete in
             bundles"257. The Commission agrees with this statement, and considers that for the
             purposes of assessing the competitive interaction between ATS traded triparty
             products, it is important to bear in mind that these products comprise three distinct
             services which are inherently linked in the product.
   (339)     When trading DBAG's GC pooling product, for example, this entails that it has to be
             cleared through DBAG's Eurex and CMS will be provided by DBAG's Clearstream.
             No other option to buy one of the three composite services from another provider, or
             dispense of one of them entirely, are available. Similarly, when trading LSEG's € GC
             plus, there is optionality on the trading layer (it can either be traded on LSEG's MTS
             or on the third party ATS BrokerTec), but it has to be cleared through LCH SA and
             CMS will be provided through Euroclear (a third party CMS provider).
   (340)     In view of the above, the Commission concludes that there is bundle-to-bundle
             competition on the market for ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos.
   7.2.2.5. For non-triparty repos traded on ATS, clearing is generally (seen as) an inherent part
             of a combined service
   (341)     In the Decision opening the proceedings and the Statement of Objections, the
             Commission preliminarily considered that ATS traded CCP cleared non-triparty
             repos compete in bundles. The Notifying Parties argue however that this approach to
             market definition is not appropriate, as customers can – or could –choose to go
             uncleared.
   (342)     On the basis of the results of the market investigation, the Commission considers that
             there are strong indications of such bundle-to-bundle competition.
   (343)     First and as already indicated in the foregoing sections, almost all ATS traded repo
             transactions are centrally cleared by a CCP, even when it is not mandatory. This is
             confirmed for example by the ECB's 2014 COGESI report, stating that "The bulk of
             repos traded in European markets are negotiated and executed on automatic trading
             systems (ATS) and most of these (over 90%) are cleared across central clearing
             counterparties (CCP)."258
   (344)     As for the Notifying Parties' ATS, the vast majority of the repos trades on their
             platforms are also cleared. On Eurex, it is obligatory to clear repos traded on ATS,
             whereas [THE LARGE MAJORITY] of the non-triparty repos traded on MTS are
             cleared.259

   (345)   When trades are not cleared, it seems to be due to regional specificities (Scandinavia,
           Spain), or because CCPs do not accept to clear corporate bonds or government bonds
           in certain currencies.260 As a result, ICMA explains that ATS traded but uncleared
           repos "are now limited to currencies in which there is still no CCP (Poland)."261
   (346)   The almost perfect correlation between ATS trading and CCP clearing is explained
           by one market participant as follows: "There is a very substantial degree of overlap
           between repos that are CCP-cleared and repos that are ATS-traded. This is
           explained by the fact that an ATS such as Eurex Repo or BrokerTec will generally
           open trading books only for standardised and thus highly liquid repos. Since the
           higher quality repos that CCPs accept for clearing are also generally highly liquid,
           eligibility for ATS trading and CCP-clearing will usually be aligned".262
   (347)   Similarly, another market participant stated that "the CCP market is very liquid and
           due to the trading platforms very easy to handle. GC pools are only tradable with
           CCP’s and also some government markets especially short dated are only possible
           on the platforms with CCP background".263
   (348)   Responses to the market investigation indicate that there are several reasons for this.
           While on two of the major ATS, CCP clearing is a binding requirement (when
           trading on Eurex (Repo) through ECAG), or always done except for particular
           circumstances (on BrokerTec, all trading members are also LCH.Clearnet clearing
           members, and 95% of the trades are cleared)264, the fact that most customers actually
           do clear seems to be predominately a result of the benefits that accrue for ATS
           traders from CCP clearing as explained in Section 7.2.2.4.
   (349)   Moreover, there are two additional key benefits for those who avail themselves of the
           combined ATS-CCP service for repos.
   (350)   First, anonymity, which trading through an ATS and clearing through a CCP
           achieves, is an important factor for a number of market participants including a large
           majority of large banks/dealers responding to the market investigation.265
   (351)   Market participants explain that anonymity is important because it contributes to
           increasing liquidity on ATS traded, CCP cleared markets. One market participant
           explained for example that "it is important because, as CCP guarantees, the name of
           the counterparty is not relevant. This anonymity increases the number of the
           counterparties accessing the market and increases liquidity".266 Similarly, one large
           dealer confirms that "We believe clearing ATS executed repo activity encourages
           market liquidity due to its anonymity".267 Even those that do not consider it important
           for themselves acknowledge this effect on liquidity "This is not important [for us],

           although anonymity may improve liquidity for weaker counterparties or issuers'
           names in times of stress (despite trading in CCP)".268
   (352)   There are however also those that appreciate anonymity due to its most direct effect:
           they simply do not want to reveal – at least in specific circumstance – that they are
           standing behind a particular trade. For example, one market participant explained
           that "anonymous trading is crucial in the following scenario:- big size orders -
           discretional and reputation risk"269 whereas another stated more generally that "it is
           important to trade anonymously on ATS to avoid sharing our positions with the
           whole market".270
   (353)   Second, the ATS-CCP combination allows for straight through processing, which a
           significant number of market participants have identified as highly beneficial. For
           example, one bank explained that trading on ATS "offers a significant advantage by
           simplifying the entire settlement chain (straight-through processing)"271, whereas
           another explains that "Trading via an ATS allows for straight through processing
           trade booking and settlement which is more favorable vs voice broking where
           bookings and clearing are more manual".272 Finally, one bank explained that
           "Straight-through processing significantly reduces operational risk / risk of
           misbookings and so on, as well as operational resources required. It also results in
           time savings for all market participants"273.
   (354)   As for the Notifying Parties' argument that their customers would regularly switch
           between uncleared and cleared ATS traded repos, the responses to the market
           investigation indicate that a significant number of customers are not aware of the
           possibility to "go uncleared" when trading on ATS.274 One of them, when asked if it
           compared uncleared and cleared repos systematically, answered that "In general, yes
           we do. However, in a number of cases (e.g. ATS), clearing is not an available option,
           rather a commitment. In all those cases, the cost becomes an irrelevant variable as it
           can[not] be considered as a determinant of the transaction".275 A large bank also
           describes as one of the specificities of ATS trading that it is "always cleared".276
           Another bank states that "trades on ATS (Eurex Repo and Btec) are always cleared
           through CCPs".277
   (355)   Thus, while it may be theoretically possible to "go uncleared" on most of the ATS, it
           seems to be an option that is partly unknown, or at least practically ignored.

   (356)   In this context, it should be noted that the vast majority of ATS customers do not
           specifically choose for each trade whether they want to clear it or not.278 Similarly,
           most customers indicated that they would not compare, for a given repo, an option
           combining ATS with going uncleared against other options combing ATS trading
           with CCP clearing.279
   (357)   For some, this process is automatic, and based on software that does not capture the
           "uncleared repo market", to the extent it exists at all for repos normally traded on
           ATS. For example, one bank explained that "Our internal system systematically
           aggregates all of the above [ATS] market quotations and displays the best bid and
           offer at any given time. Our system will automatically execute at the best level when
           trading excluding non-cleared markets".280
   (358)   As indicated above, the fact that the majority of those trading on ATS do not even
           consider going uncleared is likely to be also the result of the liquidity on ATS being
           accumulated for cleared, not uncleared repos.
   (359)   Indeed, one market participant explains that "When trading on an ATS a pre required
           field is selected to opt for execution on a cleared basis only".281 This means that the
           preference for clearing is usually made at the time when somebody enters an offer on
           an ATS.
   (360)   If now all or most of those trading on ATS check the "clearing field" (because they
           know, that for those repos, this is where the liquidity is), the choice of there being an
           uncleared option becomes almost irrelevant. There is simply no "uncleared"
           alternative offering the same rate at this very moment. The "uncleared" ATS repo
           market is therefore, to the extent it exists for repos that are normally cleared, not
           liquid. This is exactly what one market participant explains: "On the Euro Govies
           Repo Market, the vast majority of quotes on ATS are for Central Clearing".282
   (361)   In view of the above, it would seem that for most of the regular ATS users, for short-
           term repos in HQLA, the situation seems to be as one bank describes it: "When we
           trade on an ATS we always opt for CCP clearing. Only if CCP clearing is no longer
           available we settle bilateral. CCP clearing is not available for overnight trades (a
           trade executed today, starting today and ending on the next business day) which are
           closed after the CCP deadline".283

         This same market participant nuances his answer with regard to some type of repos - "However when
         they look for a special bond the bilateral trading is also possible. Trading on a bilateral basis is more
         frequent with domestic counterparties when credit lines are available". In the Commission's view, all
         this means is that the ATS-CCP combination is less (or not at all) used for certain types of repos, certain
         counterparties, or certain circumstances, including for example repos concluded after the CCP deadline.

   (362)   All the above appears to imply that for the vast majority of ATS traded repos,
           clearing is seen as a logical consequence or even an inherent, or at least a very
           important part, of a combined service.
   (363)   The Commission considers that the competitive dynamics in these markets are
           therefore best captured by defining a market consisting of bundles comprising ATS
           traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos.
   (364)   This apparent bundle-to-bundle competition is also illustrated by explanations
           obtained in the course of the Commission's market investigation. In this context
           market participants mentioned that alternatives to a non-triparty repo traded and
           cleared on Eurex are repos traded on BrokerTec, MTS or tpRepo and cleared on
           LCH Ltd, LCH SA or CC&G, depending on the underlying bond.284 Some market
           participants for example explained that, "for short dated repos in German
           Government bonds we systematically compare the liquidity of several repo trading
           platforms. Short dated repos are almost always centrally cleared. Therefore we
           either trade on Brokertec, MTS or Eurex Repo or other ATS depending on the best
           price".285 Another respondent mentioned that "we trade German Government Bonds
           on Brokertec and choose LCH Ltd as clearer of the deals because of market
           liquidity; Italian Government Bonds are conversely traded on MTS and cleared
           through CCG. We also check interests on Eurex via ECAG".286 Finally, one market
           participant states that "Eurex is a separate and unique silos (ATS-CCP), while you
           can choose which LSEG’s CCPs to clear with on MTS and BTEC (f.i. Italy on LCG
           sa od CC&G or, in the near future, Bunds on LCH Ltd or LCH sa)".287
   (365)   Further, one market participant explained that "customers who wish to clear repo
           transactions conducted on these trading platforms do not have an independent
           choice of CCP clearing service. ATSs and CCPs have long-run relationships either
           through contract or through outright vertical integration. Trading on an ATS thus
           determines where clearing occurs. As a result, [..] competition occurs with respect to
           a “stack” of complementary services comprising trading and clearing. Customers
           base their choice of trading platform not only on the products and conditions offered
           by each trading platform, but also on the conditions governing the clearing services
           they must use as part of the stack".288
   (366)   For these reasons, this market participant considers that "The significant benefits of
           CCP-cleared repos make non-cleared […] repos poor substitutes for purposes of
           defining the relevant markets. For high quality bonds with related high trading
           volumes, trading on ATS and CCP-clearing provide the most operationally and cost-
           efficient way of financing and, as a consequence, customers with eligible bonds will
           opt for ATS-traded/CCP-cleared repos barring exceptional circumstances".289

   (367)    For these reasons, the Commission considers that it is appropriate to consider that
            there is a market for bundles comprising ATS trading and CCP clearing of non-
            triparty repos.
   (368)    Alternatively, if one were to accept the Notifying Parties' argument that customers
            trading repos on ATS could choose to go uncleared, and that therefore it is
            inappropriate to consider there to be market comprising bundles of trading and
            clearing services, separate markets could be defined for these two regularly
            intertwined services. For the purposes of assessing the Transaction, and in view of
            the Notifying Parties' activities, this can be left open, as it does not have a decisive
            bearing on the competitive assessment.
   7.2.2.6. Geographic market definition
   (369)    The market investigations did not yield any evidence that would put in doubt that the
            geographic scope of repo markets, as proposed by the Notifying Parties, is EEA-
            wide.
   (370)    In the course of the market investigation, not a single respondent mentioned the
            possibility of trading or clearing a repo outside the EEA.290
   (371)    Therefore, the Commission considers that the markets for ATS traded and CCP
            cleared repos are EEA-wide.
   7.2.2.7. Conclusion on relevant markets
   (372)    In view of the foregoing, the Commission considers that, both with respect to triparty
            and non-triparty repos, ATS traded repos have to be distinguished from bilaterally
            traded repos. For ATS traded repos, cleared repos do not form part of the same
            product market as uncleared repos.
   (373)    As regards ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos, they entail a collateral
            management layer, a service performed by the triparty agent. As this service forms
            an inherent part of triparty repos, and the choice of the collateral manager is
            predetermined by where the repo is traded (and cleared), the Commission considers it
            appropriate to consider these services – ATS trading, CCP clearing and CMS – as a
            bundle and belonging to the same product market.
   (374)    As for ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos, the Commission also
            considers that ATS trading and CCP clearing, are, for a vast majority of customers,
            regarded as an inherently linked service, and are thus best assessed as a bundle.
            However, if, alternatively, a market for the clearing of ATS traded non-triparty repos
            were defined separate from the trading of ATS non-triparty repos that are CCP
            cleared, this would not affect the Commission's conclusion in the competitive
            assessment, and therefore this question can be left open.
   (375)    For bilaterally traded triparty and non-triparty repos, the questions as to whether the
            same distinctions have to be drawn can ultimately be left open, as the Notifying
            Parties do not overlap in this respect.
   (376)    Therefore, for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission considers that the
            relevant markets in relation to repos are (i) ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty

             repos, or alternatively the clearing of ATS traded non-triparty repos291 and (ii) ATS
             traded and CCP cleared triparty repos. These markets all have an EEA-wide
             geographic scope.
   7.3.      Competitive assessment
   7.3.1.    The Transaction would strengthen LSEG's dominance in the market for ATS traded
             and CCP cleared non-triparty repos in the EEA
   (377)     The Decision opening the proceedings and the Statement of Objections preliminarily
             concluded that the Transaction would likely strengthen LSEG's dominance in the
             market for ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos.
   7.3.1.1. Notifying Parties' views
   (378)     In the Notifying Parties' view, the Transaction cannot give rise to competition
             concerns given that DBAG only holds a small market share (as regards trading).
   (379)     The Notifying Parties argue that the merged entity would inter alia be constrained by
             other ATS, including notably BrokerTec, at trading level. Moreover, they would be
             constrained by repo trading based on voice brokerage or direct interactions between
             counterparties, and by providers of securities lending services. The Notifying Parties
             reiterate this argument in their response to the Statement of Objections, and refer in
             particular to one internal document of LSEG, which, as acknowledged in the
             Statement of Objections, mentions bilateral trading as a competitive constraint.
   (380)     In their response to the Decision opening the proceedings, the Notifying Parties do
             not contest that there are no other (meaningful) CCPs currently providing clearing
             services for repos. However, they argue that market participants have the choice to
             manage risk bilaterally ("go uncleared"), and that rival CCPs, in particular EuroCCP,
             could launch repo clearing within a relatively short amount of time and with limited
             investments.
   7.3.1.2. The Commission's assessment
   7.3.1.2.1. Introduction and market structure
   (381)     First, in line with the market definition of repos in Section 7.2, the Commission
             considers that the potential constraints from securities lending services and from
             bilaterally traded and uncleared repos can be dismissed, because they are not to be
             considered as meaningful substitutes.
   (382)     Second, according to the Guidelines on the assessment of horizontal mergers
             ("Horizontal Merger Guidelines"),292 a merger gives rise to a significant impediment
             to effective competition if it strengthens a firm's dominant position. The guidelines
             mention in particular that high market shares, closeness of competition between the
   291
           While the Notifying Parties also have overlapping activities on a plausible market for ATS trading of
           non-triparty repos, their market shares on this layer of the value chain are relatively modest. The
           Commission considers, in view of the assessment in the next section, that assessing competition on this
           alternative market would not be meaningful and in any event not alter its conclusion as regards the
           effects on competition resulting from the Notifying Parties' overlapping activities with respect to non-
           triparty repos traded on ATS.

   7.3.1.2.2. On the market for (clearing of) ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos,
             DBAG is a particularly close (or only) competitor to LSEG and the most important
             competitive constraint
   (386)     The Commission firstly recalls that in the area of ATS traded CCP cleared non-
             triparty repos, competition between market participants takes place in bundles
             comprising ATS trading and CCP clearing services. Even if that were not the case,
             clearing is an important, strongly related and, for many customers trading non-
             triparty repos on ATS, indispensable service. As one market participant explains,
             "the fact that the clearing service is of higher value than the trading service makes
             the competiveness of the clearing service critical to the competiveness of the overall
             stack".294
   (387)     Therefore, despite their different business models,295 the Notifying Parties clearly
             compete in the market for ATS traded CCP cleared repos.
   (388)     Following the Transaction, the merged entity will control de facto all clearing
             houses296 in the EEA active in ATS traded non-triparty repo clearing. While at the
             trading level the merged entity will continue to face competition from rival ATS that
             currently account for approximately [70-80%] of the market, this competitive
             constraint would be, as a result of the Transaction, lessened through the fact that
             customers trading on the platforms of these competitors rely on LSEG for the
             clearing service – an indispensable service for ATS traded repos.
   (389)     It is therefore not surprising that, even though Eurex currently is a relatively minor
             player in this market, it follows clearly from the results of the market investigation,
             [BUSINESS SECRETS] that it exerts significant competitive pressure on LSEG’s
             repo clearing business. In fact, there are no indications from the market investigation
             that any other company – a rival trading platform or clearing houses – is regarded as
             a competitive constraint by either the Notifying Parties or market participants.

   (393)     In the Commission's view, [BUSINESS SECRETS] This quote therefore illustrates
             well how the Transaction could harm competition in a number of ways.
   (394)     First, it may eliminate or at least reduce the constant need to innovate in the
             competitive race to retain customers, which is a common feature of financial

   295
           See above Section 7.1.
   296
           There are also some minor players such as Meffclear for Spanish bonds. As there are neither indications
           from the market investigation nor submission from the Notifying Parties that these CCPs play a
           meaningful role for the competitive dynamics in this space, the Commission will disregard them for the
           remainder of its analysis.

           infrastructure markets. This concern is also shared by market participants. One
           customer confirmed that the Transaction might stifle innovation of future
           competition in this field, and explained that "Eurex clearing is the only one to clear
           equity repos. No direct competition actually. But the merger would prevent LSE to
           implement its own equity clearing offer."300
   (395)   Second, it shows that even though Eurex does not [BUSINESS SECRETS] allow
           customers trading on rival ATS to clear through its CCP, the mere possibility that it
           could do so constrains the incumbent repo clearing houses of LSEG.
   (396)   Third, it illustrates that, in particular for repos based on German government bonds
           ("bunds") to which it refers more specifically, the (pricing) constraint that the
           Notifying Parties exercise on each other are particularly pronounced and important.
   (397)   DBAG's internal documents show a similar picture. In 2012, in a presentation
           [BUSINESS SECRETS].301 [BUSINESS SECRETS].302
   (398)   It follows from the above that, given that the only relevant competitive constraint is
           eliminated as a result of the Transaction, the merged entity will be in a position to
           exert pricing control over ATS traded non-triparty repos.
   (399)   This is because through the disappearance of the only competitor that is clearing non-
           triparty repos, the merged entity will have the ability to simultaneously increase the
           prices for clearing services without running the risk of leaking customers to other
           CCPs (or trading venues), because the customers trading on non-triparty repos on
           ATS have to clear through one of the Notifying Parties' clearing houses.303
   (400)   During the Phase I and Phase II market investigation, a number of the Notifying
           Parties’ repo customers expressed concerns about the impact of the concentration
           brought about by the merger at the repo clearing level. In this context, one market
           participant expressed that as a result of the Transaction, "three major CCPs in
           Europe (Eurex Clearing, LCH SA, LCH Ltd) would be owned by the same company.
           […]. Therefore the CCPs would be in the situation to define the rules for doing repo
           business".304
   (401)   In view of the foregoing, it is of limited relevance that the increment brought about
           by the transaction is relatively minor, that BrokerTec seems to be a close competitor
           to each of the Notifying Parties at the trading level,305 and that the Notifying Parties'
           ATS seem to predominately compete only with respect to both German and Italian
           bonds,306 because importantly, the Transaction eliminates the only competitor of

             of clearing ATS traded non-triparty repos, the merged entity would be in a position
             to unilaterally increase prices for ATS traded CCP cleared repos, because in either
             scenario, there would not be an independent competitor that could replace the
             constraint that DBAG currently exerts on LSEG.
   7.3.1.2.3.Absent the Transaction, T2S (and other developments) would further intensify
             competition between the Notifying Parties
   (402)     With the gradual switch to T2S,307 there are strong indications that competition
             between the Notifying Parties, in both the market for ATS traded and CCP cleared
             triparty repos (see below Section 7.3.2.2.3) and in the market(s) for ATS traded (and
             CCP cleared) non-triparty repos would, absent the merger, further intensify, to the
             benefit of customers. Such an increase in competition is expected as a result of cross-
             system settlement becoming cheaper and faster through T2S, as well as through LCH
             SA possibly opening an account in Clearstream Frankfurt, which means that
             customers will not have to take into account any longer the additional cost, risk and
             inconvenience of having to move collateral across settlement systems when trading
             and clearing repos.
   (403)     To illustrate the above points, the Commission refers to a DBAG internal email
             exchange308 relating to [DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF A HYPOTHETICAL
             FUTURE POSSIBILITY FOR LCH CUSTOMERS TO SETTLE BUND REPOS IN
             CLEARSTREAM].309
   (404)     The decision of LSEG/LCH.Clearnet to [EXPAND INTO BUND REPO
             CLEARING SERVICES AT LCH SA] and described in more detail below in
             Section 11.2.1.1, apparently caused some concern [BUSINESS SECRETS].310
   (405)     It follows from the above that both parties to the Transaction clearly expect
             competition in ATS traded non-triparty repos to intensify going forward.
   (406)     The results of the market investigation suggest that this expectation is shared by a
             large number of market participants, including in particular some of the largest banks
             and dealers.311 One market participant, for example, explains that "Once T2S is
             implemented across all participating CS[D]s in the EEA the current limitations with
             respect to moving collateral will be gone. In the short time that should increase the
           this stage, and for the purposes of the Decision, the Commission considers that this would
           predominately relate to repo trades in which the liquidity on ATS is relatively limited, or that are
           unsuitable for ATS trading due to duration, size or complexity. The Commission notes that in response
           to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties refer to these isolated statements, and submit that
           in none of these statements the respondents to the market investigation have indicated that certain types
           of repos are unsuitable for ATS trading. The Commission did not state that they did, and considers that
           in view of the evidence on file, there are evidently certain repos (complex, long deal possibly based on
           uncommon collateral) that are unsuitable for ATS trading.

             competition between the several ATSs".312 Similarly, another market participant
             confirmed that "T2S offers settlement and payment harmonization which might lead
             to higher competition of ATS trading non-triparty repos".313 In the same vein one
             market participant even anticipates that as a result of T2S, there will be "increased
             competition [which] may lead to fee reduction (on Eurex)".314
   (407)     While some of the above statements refer specifically to trading, they apply, in the
             Commission's view, equally to clearing. This can be deduced from [BUSINESS
             SECRETS], as well as from the Commission's explanation in Section 7.2.2 on market
             definition regarding the quasi-inherent link between trading and clearing of non-
             triparty repos: as there is de-facto no trading on ATS without clearing, clearing
             appears to be an indispensable service for many of those trading on ATS, and
             intensification of competition in ATS for trading non-triparty repos would
             necessarily entail an intensification of competition between the CCPs clearing ATS
             traded non-triparty repos: DBAG and LSEG.
   (408)     This intensification of competition would be eliminated as a result of the
             Transaction.
   7.3.1.2.4. Entry is unlikely and in any event not a significant competitive constraint
   (409)     In their response to the Decision opening the proceedings, the Notifying Parties
             argue that EuroCCP would be a rival clearing house that would be particularly well
             placed to enter the repo clearing market should anticompetitive effects materialise as
             a result of the Transaction.
   (410)     First, the Commission recalls that barriers to entry into financial infrastructure
             markets are high, due to in particular strong network effects and economies of scale
             and scope.315 A new entrant would have to obtain the support of a sufficient number
             of market participants, contend with high regulatory requirements and high
             investments, as well as achieve low costs and propose an innovative / different
             offering to what existing CCPs supply in order to be successful.316
   (411)     These considerations also hold true for repo clearing, [BUSINESS SECRETS].317
             And with the chances for a successful entry of even a large, sophisticated clearing
             house with experience in repo clearing outside the EEA being low, the likelihood
             that this CCP (or another) would attempt to enter are even lower.
   (412)     Second, the market investigation did not reveal any indications of a future entry (or
             expansion from a neighbouring market) into the repo clearing market either by
             EuroCCP or any other clearing house.
   (413)     Indeed, EuroCCP itself indicated that it is not considering entering this market. It
             explained that it "is considering to enter the area of clearing of stock loans (i.e.
             securities lending), segment […] As EuroCCP is already active in equity clearing,
             there is a business case for expanding into stock loan clearing. EuroCCP started to

          examine stock loan clearing in late 2015. If a decision to proceed with the initiative
          and submit for regulatory filing is taken in December 2016 / January 2017,
          EuroCCP aims to start an initial service offering in Q3/Q4 2017. […] EuroCCP
          does not clear fixed income (either repos or bonds) and is not considering to enter
          this area. It is not easy for a CCP not active in fixed income clearing to enter this
          market: first, it requires to obtain a specific EMIR authorisation; second, and most
          importantly, clearing is characterised by high network effects and high fixed costs
          which constitute barriers to entry for potential new players. It would need to develop
          an entirely new management system for fixed income which requires investments and
          would increase EuroCCPs fixed costs (e.g. by engaging additional employees). Since
          every CCP needs to have a critical mass to operate, the defection of only a few
          companies (in case they decided, e.g. to sponsor the entry of a new CCP) from a
          CCP would not be sufficient for a new entrant to be viable. Furthermore, sponsors
          will incur additional costs due to the continued requirement to use the first CCP
          when transacting with counterparties who have chosen not to leave; this is a
          disincentive for firms to sponsor a new CCP. In short, compared to starting to clear
          equity lending transaction, entering the fixed income clearing space (i.e. clearing of
          repos and bonds) would take significantly longer, entail much higher investments (in
          terms e.g. of risk management enhancement, validation, etc.) and increased fixed
          costs, while commercial barriers to entry are also much higher".318
   (414)  The results of the market investigation also strongly indicate that the Notifying
          Parties' argument that EuroCCP would be a strong constraint as it could swiftly and
          easily enter, is not plausible. In fact, aside from EuroCCP's own assessment as
          reported above, not a single market participant mentioned EuroCCP when asked
          which company could potentially start to clear repos in the next 1-3 years.319 More
          generally speaking, a clear majority of respondents did not expect any company to
          enter, or could not think of any company that would do so.320
   (415)  In any event, the Commission has not received any evidence to indicate that a rival
          clearing house currently has plans to start clearing (non-triparty) repos. The
          Commission also notes that not only are there no other CCPs clearing repos that
          could constrain the merged entity going forward, but there are also no other clearing
          houses active in the bond area, which, given that most cleared repos are based on
          bonds, could therefore find it easier to expand their offering into this market.
   (416)  In view of the explanations of EuroCCP, namely that it is much more challenging, as
          well as time and cost intensive to expand beyond an existing asset class (such as
          equities for example), the Commission considers that any potential entry could not
          possibly be considered as likely, timely and sufficient to deter or defeat any anti-
          competitive effects of the Transaction.321
   (417)  Finally, the absence of countervailing entry is also evidenced by the fact that a
          majority of respondents to the market investigation consider that trading and/or

            clearing fees for ATS traded CCP cleared non-triparty repos might increase as a
            result of the Transaction.322
   7.3.1.2.5. Conclusion
   (418)    In view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that, considering the fact that
            the Transaction would result in eliminating the only other player active in clearing
            ATS traded non-triparty repos, the importance of clearing for customers trading non-
            triparty repos on ATS, and the lack of likely entry, the Transaction would lead to a
            significant impediment of effective competition through the strengthening of a
            dominant position on the market(s) for ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty
            repos in the EEA, regardless of whether the markets are defined as a combined
            market for the trading and clearing of ATS traded non-triparty repos or a market for
            clearing of ATS traded non-triparty repos that is separate from trading of ATS non-
            triparty repos that are CCP cleared.
   7.3.2.   The Transaction would strengthen DBAG's dominant position in the market for ATS
            traded and CCP cleared triparty repos in the EEA
   (419)    In the Statement of Objections, the Commission preliminarily concluded that the
            Transaction would likely strengthen the dominant position of DBAG in the market
            for ATS traded (and CCP cleared) triparty repos by eliminating a particularly close
            (and only) competitor.
   7.3.2.1. Notifying Parties' view
   (420)    In their response to the Decision opening the proceedings, the Notifying Parties
            recall that the increment arising from the Transaction is very small as LSEG's
            presence is minimal [BUSINESS SECRETS].
   (421)    Moreover, and also in response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties
            submit that their main triparty products (GC Pooling and €GC Plus) are not close
            competitors, as DBAG has not reacted in any way to the market entry of LSEG. In
            addition, according to the Notifying Parties, for each of them, non-ATS traded
            triparty products would be closer alternatives. This is because the use of these
            products is linked to where customers' collateral is held (Euroclear or Clearstream),
            and if customers wanted to switch to an alternative (triparty) repo, they would
            instead forgo ATS trading (and clearing), and trade repos bilaterally, while retaining
            Euroclear or Clearstream as CMS providers. Moreover, the necessary moving of
            collateral which would be necessary to trade the respective other triparty product
            would be time consuming and costly, and would not be undertaken solely for the
            purposes of trading on a rival triparty ATS.
   (422)    Finally, the Notifying Parties submit that the refinancing operations with central
            banks have increasingly substituted "public" liquidity provision to private liquidity.
            In the Notifying Parties' response to the Decision opening the proceedings, they
            argue that even if central banks were to scale back their operations, the commercial
            repo markets are unlikely to attain the volumes again in the mid-term that they had
            prior to central banks' interventions.

   (436)   In their response to the Decision opening the proceedings, the Notifying Parties
           emphasise in particular that DBAG has neither responded in any way to the market
           entry of LSEG, in particular not by decreasing fees, nor does it regard €GC Plus as a
           competitor.
   (437)   First, the claim that DBAG does not see €GC Plus as a competitor contradicts both
           the spirit and the letter of the internal documents quoted above. Second, the
           Commission notes that the absence of a fee decrease, as confirmed by the results of
           the market investigation,331 is not necessarily evidence of there not being a
           competitive interaction between the products. In the absence of LSEG's market entry,
           it is possible that DBAG would have increased its prices ([BUSINESS

   (438)   In any event, DBAG reacted already before that point in time. [BUSINESS
           SECRETS].333 334
   (439)   As for the success of €GC Plus, it is true that until now, as DBAG predicted,
           [BUSINESS SECRETS], and most market participants do not regard €GC Plus as
           being similarly attractive as GC Pooling.335 [PARTIES' CONFIDENTIAL VIEWS
           ON THE PERFORMANCE OF GC PLUS] there is no immediately visible
           correlation between the volumes traded on GC Pooling and €GC Plus on the other
           hand. [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ON THE GROWTH OF €GC PLUS
           AND POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS].336 Another internal document of LSEG
           [BUSINESS SECRETS].337
   (440)   Moreover, and with respect to the Parties' argument that Banque the France is
           currently the only (meaningful) cash provider for €GC Plus, and overall accounts for
           a substantial share of €GC Plus volumes, the Commission considers the apparent
           continuous support of this product through the French central bank rather as a
           strength of €GC Plus [BUSINESS SECRETS].
   (441)   In addition, BrokerTec, an ATS on which €GC Plus can be traded, notes that "LCH
           SA has a growing importance in the GC market, even if right now only 10-15 of the
           60-65 banks active on Brokertec are able to trade it".338 As will be further described
           below, the undeniable competitive interaction between these products will likely
           intensify going forward. Moreover, [BUSINESS SECRETS], internal documents of
           LSEG confirm that a Spanish bank is at the very least interested in joining.339
           [BUSINESS SECRETS]340
   (442)   That the Notifying Parties' triparty products compete is also evidenced by the results
           of the market investigation. For example, the vast majority of market participants
           mentioned €GC Plus (or the other LSEG products to a lesser extent) as the only (or at
           least very close) alternative to GC Pooling, while only very few referred to other
           bilaterally traded uncleared triparty repos,341 and none referred to any other products.
           Market participants explained that these two products were alternatives because "they
           are the two biggest European markets for collateral pooling and they offer almost
           the same types of collateral, operational standards and services,"342 because of a
           "similar collateral pool, both traded electronically, similar clearing process"343 and
           because they are both "cleared triparty on similar baskets"344. Further, one market

   (443)    Finally, one market participant pointed to the clear existence of a competitive
            constraint exercised by LSEG on the incumbent (DBAG) stating with respect to the
            competition between the Notifying Parties' products that "there are strong network
            effects that attract traders to the most liquid instrument which is currently GC
            pooling. However, in the long run, alternatives would be important to keep prices
            low.346
   (444)    Euroclear, the CMS provider of €GC Plus, also submits that its launch was a "direct
            competitive response to the GC Pooling product. Although the €GC Plus share in
            triparty cleared repos is currently modest, it is growing as it offers customers a
            credible competitive alternative."347
   (445)    In view of the above, the Commission considers that LSEG's attempts to break into a
            market in which DBAG had prior to that a monopoly position, have led to the
            emergence of competitive constraints for DBAG that did not exist before. Those
            would inevitably disappear as a result of the Transaction, which would restore
            DBAG's monopoly.
   7.3.2.2.3. The Notifying Parties' products compete despite being in different collateral pools –
   and absent the Transaction, T2S (and other developments) would further intensify this
   competition
   (446)    The Commission considers the fact that the Notifying Parties' products relate to
            different pools of collateral does not mean that they do not constrain each other.
            Customers regard their respective triparty products as competing products.348 When
            identifying direct alternatives to €GC Plus, customers frequently identified GC
            Pooling as competing product because they have similar features and provide the
            same value proposition for customers: electronic trading, straight-through
            processing, ability to clear, similar baskets. ("Same ability to clear ECB Italian
            eligible collateral baskets."349; "Direct link to Centralbank. Pooled collateral.
            Automated straight through process."350; "they are among the more important
            European markets for collateral pooling and they offer almost the same types of
            collateral, operational standards and services."351).
   (447)    As for the Notifying Parties' argument, reiterated in the response to the Statement of
            Objections, that there is no competition between the Notifying Parties' products,
            because switching would entail the cost and time intensive movement of collateral
            from Euroclear to Eurex, the Commission acknowledges that frequent switching
            between the two stacks is indeed unlikely to happen given the associated burden,352
            and market participants generally indicated that they have not switched in the past.353
   (448)    The fact that the collateral pools to which the Notifying Parties' products are linked
            act as a limitation to daily switching is also confirmed by BrokerTec, the third party
            ATS on which €GC Plus can be traded, who explains that "the choice between

          different tri-party repo products depends to a large extent on the ICSD used by the
          counterparties to a transaction. That means that investors with collateral in
          Clearstream would generally opt for GC pooling, whereas those with collateral in
          Euroclear could go for €GC Plus. Of course the collateral could be moved, but this
          is relatively complex (even more so as regards government bonds – every time a
          bond is moved, the issuer CSD would have to be notified)"354. Nonetheless,
          BrokerTec also indicates that some large customers would however have collateral in
          both ICSDs, and could thus more easily use both products in parallel, and hence
          switch also on a daily basis. The results of the market investigation indeed confirm
          that there appear to be some banks that are active on both.355 [BUSINESS
          SECRETS]356
   (449)  The Commission also acknowledges, that market participants, when asked what they
          would do when they could not obtain an appropriate rate on DBAG's GC pooling,
          answers were inconclusive, and they mentioned essentially all types of repos (and
          even other investment possibilities) as possible alternatives.357 The answer of one
          market participant is particularly illustrative in this regard, who explained that
          "alternatives for lending cash would be specific reverse repo, GC vs narrow/wide
          baskets, outright govt bond/bill".358
   (450)  In view of the above and all the evidence on file, the Commission considers that not
          all customers using GC Pooling could indeed easily on a day-to-day basis switch
          between the Notifying Parties' products, as this would require having similar
          collateral both in Clearstream and in Euroclear, which, as explained above, and
          submitted by the Notifying Parties, is inefficient at this point in time.
   (451)  Nonetheless, the Commission considers that it would be ignoring the competitive
          dynamics in this market if it were to limit its assessment on the possibility and
          feasibility of day-to-day switching only. In the Commission's view, it also has to take
          into account the fact that absent the Transaction, a GC pooling customer could move
          its collateral from Clearstream to Euroclear and start trading €GC Plus, or at least
          threaten to do so, which, [BUSINESS SECRETS] constrains DBAG. Therefore, the
          Commission also has to take account of the systemic-type of competition between
          the Notifying Parties to attract customers' ATS triparty business.
   (452)  With every customer that €GC Plus wins, this threat and constraint becomes more
          effective (in particular if it were a cash-provider, which, according to the Notifying
          Parties, €GC Plus lacks right now), and the advantage that the DBAG/Clearstream
          environment enjoys in this regard vis-à-vis the Euroclear/LSEG offer shrinks.
   (453)  In any event, as demonstrated in the next paragraphs, absent the Transaction,
          switching between the Notifying Parties' products will become increasingly simple
          going forward, which will further intensify competition between their products, as a
          result of cross-system settlement becoming cheaper and faster, as explained above
          with respect to non-triparty repos.

   (454)    To illustrate, the Commission refers again to DBAG internal email exchange
            mentioned above in Section 7.3.1.2.3 [BUSINESS SECRETS]359
   (455)    This exchange demonstrates that even if the Notifying Parties' claims were correct
            that so far the competitive constraint exercised by €GC Plus on GC Pooling were
            limited, it would increase going forward and be eliminated as a result of the
            Transaction.
   (456)    As a result of this development, a considerable share of market participants expect
            competition to intensify between the Notifying Parties' ATS traded triparty
            products.360 For example, one market participant explains that "T2S offers settlement
            and payment harmonization which might lead to higher competition between
            EuroGC+ and General Collateral Pooling"361 while another confirms that "T2S will
            increase efficiency and thus is expected to increase trading activity in both products.
            This is expected to increase competition and liquidity".362
   (457)    In view of the above, the Commission considers that, absent the Transaction, the
            Notifying Parties would compete more fiercely in this market going forward. Were
            the Transaction to proceed, however, this competition would be eliminated and
            Eurex' monopoly in ATS traded CCP cleared triparty repos would be restored.
   7.3.2.2.4.Central banks' activities cannot be considered as replicating the constraint the
   Notifying Parties exert on each other
   (458)    In their responses to the Decision of opening the proceedings, as well as to the
            Statement of objections, the Notifying Parties reiterate [DISCUSSION OF
            RELATION BETWEEN MONETARY POLICY AND REPO MARKETS].
   (459)    In the Commission's view, it cannot be disputed that the market has shrunk.
            [BUSINESS SECRETS]363 364 Nor can the Commission judge if the market size will
            recover. However, the size of the market has no decisive bearing on the question as
            to whether the Notifying Parties' products compete. If anything, one would expect
            competition to intensify in a shrinking market, an effect that would likely be
            eliminated by the Transaction.
   (460)    The Commission also would not consider it as appropriate to see central banks
            through quantitative easing programs as competitors to the Notifying Parties. First,
            respondents to the market investigation mentioned central bank refinancing
            operations as a possibility to obtain funding only anecdotally. Second, while the
            Commission cannot predict how long the central banks including the ECB will
            continue its current policies, it would not be correct to qualify these temporary
            operations as a structural constraint. Therefore, central banks cannot be seen as being
            actors on the same market as the triparty products traded and cleared on the
            Notifying Parties' platforms.365

   7.3.2.2.5. Entry is unlikely and in any event not a significant competitive constraint
   (461)    Generally speaking, the entry of a rival CCP into the repo clearing space, as
            discussed above in Section 7.3.1.2.4, seems unlikely and therefore not able to
            constrain the Notifying Parties.
   (462)    This is even more so as regards ATS traded and centrally cleared triparty repos,
            which also require, crucially, a CMS provider that jointly develops such a product
            with a clearing house. According to DBAG, [TIME TO DEVELOP €GC PLUS].366,
            LSEG explain in an internal document, [THAT IT TOOK SEVERAL YEARS TO
            DEVELOP THE €GC+ CLEARED REPO PRODUCT].367
   (463)    Therefore, the entry of a new player, which the Commission in any event could not
            even theoretically identify in the course of its market investigation, appears for
            practical purposes excluded in the medium term.
   (464)    Finally, the absence of countervailing entry is also evidenced by the fact that a
            majority of respondents to the market investigation consider that trading and/or
            clearing fees for ATS traded non-triparty repos might increase as a result of the
            Transaction.368
   7.3.2.2.6. Conclusion
   (465)    In view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that, considering the high
            market shares of the Notifying Parties, the elimination of DBAG's sole competitor,
            the likely intensification of competition that is expected to occur absent the
            Transaction and the lack of likely entry, the Transaction would lead to a significant
            impediment of effective competition through the strengthening of a dominant
            position on the market for ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos in the EEA.
   8.       POST-TRADE SERVICES (SETTLEMENT, CUSTODY, COLLATERAL
            MANAGMENT)
   8.1.     Introduction to settlement, custody and collateral management
   (466)    Settlement is the final stage of the trading life cycle, involving the actual discharge of
            the obligations resulting from the trade, i.e. the payment of monies and the delivery
            of securities.
   (467)    Settlement service can be provided by the relevant national or international Central
            Securities Depositaries ("CSDs" or "ICSDs", respectively), which have issued the
            security to be settled and is then referred to as primary settlement.
   (468)    In some cases, a settlement service is provided by intermediaries (which can be
            (I)CSDs or, in most cases, custodians), in which case it is referred to as secondary
            settlement.
   (469)    Settlement encompasses either (i) internalised transactions, where a transaction has
            taken place between two customers of the same service provider, making it possible
            for the transaction to be carried out in the books of that service provider, without any
            corresponding entries being made at CSD level; or (ii) mirror transactions by which

            the service providers of each counterparty make the account entries in their
            customers’ accounts necessary to reflect the result of the clearing and settlement
            carried out by the issuer CSD. Providers of settlement services will choose direct or
            indirect access to the issuer CSD depending on their requirements as a user, such as
            the volumes to be processed or the level of service they offer to their customers.
   (470)    Settlement services are often provided together with custody services, which refer to
            safe-keeping services such as the maintenance of securities accounts on behalf of
            investors and the processing of corporate actions like dividend and interest payments
            or voting rights in the case of shares.
   (471)    A new equity – when listed and admitted to trading – must be deposited with a CSD:
            the issuer CSD, where the security is physically or electronically deposited at the top
            tier level of accounts. Until recently, this function has usually been undertaken by the
            national CSD in the country under the laws of which a security was issued. This is
            changing under the recently adopted Central Securities Depositories Regulation
            ("CSDR" or "CSD Regulation")369, which grants issuers the right to use any
            authorised EEA CSD, to issue their security.
   (472)    Similarly to settlement services, custody services can be provided to investors by the
            CSD where the security was issued (final custody) or by service providers other than
            the issuer CSD, if these maintain (directly or via other service providers) an account
            with the issuer CSD (intermediate custody services).
   (473)    Collateral management consists in managing and optimising the use of securities as
            collateral in different types of transactions (for example repo transactions, securities
            lending, derivative transactions). Margin requirements (or collateral) are normally
            composed of: (i) additional (initial) margin intended to provide collateral to open a
            position calculated by reference to the risk associated with the transaction/contract in
            question; and (ii) maintenance (variation) margin which represents the amount
            needed to collateralise the open positions at the end of the day, reflecting the changes
            in market prices. Where a transaction is centrally cleared by a CCP, margins are put
            in the margin pool of the CCP. When the transaction is bilateral, counterparty credit
            risk is managed between the parties through the negotiation of collateral payments.
            The counterparties are free to decide the amount of collateral, if any, which must be
            posted. The need for collateral management is triggered by the requirement to assess
            the value and potentially substitute the collateral on an ongoing basis. This can be
            done in-house or by a third party, generally an (I)CSD or a custodian.
   (474)    The collateral management service ("CMS") provider also referred to as triparty
            agent in particular in triparty repos, ensures maintenance of the value, quality and
            performance of the collateral, which entails the substitution of securities if so needed.
            In relation to triparty services, the CMS provider generally holds the collateral in a
            single account (that contains securities of the buyer and seller) at an ICSD or a CSD.

   (477)    Monte Titoli has launched its proprietary platform X-COM, a CMS for triparty
            repos, at the end of 2015. For the other triparty repos that are traded and / or cleared
            on LSEG venues, i.e. Term £GC and €GC Plus, CMS is provided by a third party

   8.3.1.1. Settlement and custody
   (478)    As regards the relevant product market, the Notifying Parties first submit that
            primary and secondary settlement services are separate markets, considering that
            there is neither demand-side nor supply-side substitutability for those services.
   (479)    The Notifying Parties submit that, under CSDR, a CSD performs three core
            functions: (i) the initial recording of securities in a book-entry system (notary
            service); (ii) providing and maintaining securities accounts at the top tier level
            (central maintenance service); and (iii) operating a securities settlement system
            (settlement service). Because these functions cannot be performed by a custodian, the
            Notifying Parties submit that there is no competition between custodians and CSDs
            in respect of these core services, including primary settlement (and final custody
            services). More specifically, the Notifying Parties consider that primary settlement is
            performed by the national CSD where the relevant securities reside and, as such, the
            settlement of a trade can be completely implemented by the CSD, contrary to
            secondary settlement.
   (480)    As regards a potential distinction between ICSDs and CSDs, the Notifying Parties
            consider that, while in principle ICSDs and CSDs can offer issuer-services for the
            same types of securities, in practice there are some limitations to the issuer-CSD
            services that ICSDs can offer for specific securities in practice, for example the
            provision of issuer-services for company-issued equities listed in Italy. Furthermore,
            as a result of historic commercial considerations, CSDs and ICSDs tend to specialise
            in certain instrument types, for example, ICSDs are the issuer-CSD for Eurobonds
            and thus predominantly offer final custody and primary settlement for Eurobonds,370
            while domestic CSDs cover domestically listed equities and debt instruments. The
            Notifying Parties nevertheless do not propose to distinguish between services
            provided by CSDs and by ICSDs.
   370
           Eurobonds are international bonds denominated in a different currency from that of the country in
           which they are issued.
EN                                                   89                                                      EN

   (481)   In contrast to primary settlement, secondary settlement is provided by
           intermediaries371 that hold securities with the CSD in their name but on behalf of
           customers. These providers can settle in-house transactions occurring between their
           customers without involving the CSD where the securities reside.
   (482)   Second, the Notifying Parties consider that a plausible distinction can be made
           between (i) settlement services; and (ii) custody services, and within the latter, a
           further plausible sub-segmentation between final custody, provided by the (I)CSD
           that has issued the respective security and intermediary custody, provided by either
           (I)CSDs or custodians other than the issuing CSD.
   (483)   Third, the Notifying Parties further submit that the lack of competition between
           CSDs of different countries (because generally securities issued under the laws of
           one country reside in the CSD of that country) implies that there are different
           markets for primary settlement services relating to securities issued in different
           Member States.
   (484)   Fourth, the Notifying Parties do not propose to define separate markets on the basis
           of the type of security or transaction (for example equities, bonds, repos, etc.).
   (485)   As regards the geographic market definition, the Notifying Parties propose different
           scopes depending on the market, but consider that the Transaction does not raise
           competition concerns under any of the possible alternative geographic market
           definitions.
   (486)   First, as regards primary settlement, the Notifying Parties consider the relevant
           geographic market to be national. Despite the fact that the implementation of
           TARGET2-Securities ("T2S")372 and CSDR373 is likely to lead to increased cross-
           border competition among CSDs, the geographic market is currently, and will remain
           for the foreseeable future national and cross-border competition for issuers’ business
           will not immediately flourish.
   (487)   Second, as regards secondary settlement, the Notifying Parties consider that the
           market is at least EEA-wide since these services can be provided by intermediaries
           anywhere in the world.
   (488)   Third, as regards intermediate custody, the Notifying Parties have submitted that the
           market for these services should be global in scope as this is consistent with the
           broad basis on which custodians can offer their services.
   (489)   Fourth, as regards final custody services, the Notifying Parties consider that there is
           to date very limited competition between different national CSDs for these services.
           Domestic securities tend to be issued (and therefore their physical/electronic book-
           entry records lie) with the domestic CSD under the laws of the country in which they
           were issued.
   371
         Domestic CSDs, and mostly ICSDs and custodians.

         See above Sections 7.3.1.2.3. and 7.3.2.2.3. T2S (TARGET 2-Securities) is a new European securities
         settlement engine which aims to offer centralised delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement in central
         bank funds across all euro-denominated securities markets.
   373
         CSDR grants issuers in particular the right to use any authorised EEA CSD to issue their security.
EN                                                      90                                                     EN

   8.3.1.2. Collateral management
   (490)     The Notifying Parties consider that the relevant market should comprise the
             provision of CMS for different collateral takers (i.e. central banks, CCPs, trading
             counterparties, etc.) and different types of transactions (i.e. repos, bonds, equities,
             derivatives margins, etc.).
   (491)     While from a demand-side perspective, CMS may be specific and not be
             interchangeable with services required for different infrastructures (a CCP for
             example), the Notifying Parties submit that, to the extent that these services differ at
             the margins, CMS providers have the necessary supply-side flexibility to offer
             collateral management services irrespective of the collateral taker or the type of
             transaction. Triparty CMS agents tend to multiply the type of exposures that their
             clients can collateralise through the same triparty CMS and custodian (i.e., pledges
             with central banks, triparty repos, securities lending, derivatives margining, secured
             loans, secured certificates, etc.) in order to consolidate assets of the participants and
             to offer as many possible alternatives for trading, funding, securities financing and
             margining without a need to transfer the underlying assets to another custodian.
   (492)     The Notifying Parties submit that the geographic scope of the relevant market is
             global excluding the US, in view of the fact that market participants increasingly rely
             on CMS providers outside the EEA. Nonetheless, the Notifying Parties base their
             competitive analysis on an EEA wide market, submitting that defining either an EEA
             wide or global market, excluding the US, does not make a difference to the
             competitive assessment.
   8.3.2.    The Commission's assessment
   8.3.2.1. Settlement and custody
   8.3.2.1.1. Investor-facing services do not form part of the same market as issuer-facing
             services
   (493)     Issuer-facing services are provided by CSDs374 and include issuance and notary
             services, which are services for issuers of securities. A new equity – when listed and
             admitted to trading – must be deposited with a CSD: the "issuer CSD", where the
             security is physically or electronically deposited for safekeeping. Until recently, this
             function could legally only be undertaken by the national CSD in the country under
             the laws of which a security was issued (listed). This is changing under the recently
             adopted CSD Regulation, which grants issuers the right to use any authorised EEA
             CSD, to issue their security.
   (494)     Other issuer-facing services include services such as: (a) services related to
             shareholders’ registers; (b) supporting the processing of corporate actions, including
             tax, general meetings and information services; (c) new issue services, including
             allocation and management of ISIN codes and similar codes; (d) instruction routing
             and processing, fee collection and processing and related reporting.
   (495)     Investor-facing services include the settlement, and the provision and maintenance of
             securities accounts, including custody. Such investor-facing settlement and custody
             services can be provided by the issuer CSD (i.e. national CSDs for national securities
   374
           ICSDs in the case of Eurobonds. Eurobonds are international bonds denominated in a different currency
           from that of the country in which they are issued.
EN                                                        91                                                     EN

            and ICSDs for Eurobonds), or by intermediaries (i.e. investor CSDs, mostly ICSDs,
            or custodians).
   (496)    In Clearstream,375 the Commission considered that for customers that were
            intermediaries and were requiring access to the issuer CSD, indirect access is not a
            valid alternative, and thus distinguished between primary settlement and secondary
            settlement. The analysis was conducted from the point of view of intermediaries
            which needed access to the German CSD in order to be able to provide post-trading
            services in relation to German securities. Primary settlement and final custody were
            thus not considered substitutable with secondary settlement and intermediate
            custody.
   (497)    The Commission considered in DBAG/NYSE Euronext a potential distinction
            between primary settlement on one hand, and secondary settlement on the other
            hand.376 The Commission acknowledged the existence of domestic rules in different
            Member States regulating services provided by national CSDs, and thus assessed the
            impact of the transaction on settlement services on the basis of separate markets for
            primary and secondary settlement. However, the Commission ultimately decided to
            leave the exact product market definition open since the assessment would not
            change under any definition.377
   (498)    The customers considered in the case at hand (contrary to Clearstream) are issuers
            on the one hand and investors on the other hand. As regards issuers, only CSDs (and
            ICSDs for Eurobonds) can provide custody services; the distinction primary
            settlement and final custody (direct access to the CSD) vs secondary settlement and
            intermediate custody (intermediated access to the CSD) thus does not relate to issuer-
            facing services. As regards investors, there is prima facie no reason to distinguish
            primary settlement and final custody from secondary settlement and intermediate
            custody, on the mere basis that settlement and custody services would be provided by
            a CSD through a direct access to the CSD or by intermediaries. Whether these
            services are substitutable from an investor perspective will be analysed below.
   (499)    Therefore, the Commission concludes that, for the purposes of this Decision,
            investor-facing services do not form part of the same product market as issuer-facing
            services. As regards issuer-facing services, the exact market definition and, in
            particular, the question of whether a distinction should be drawn between ICSDs for
            Eurobonds and CSDs can be left open for the purposes of this Decision as it does not
            affect the Commission's competitive assessment in relation to settlement and custody
            services.
   8.3.2.1.2. Issuer-facing services: The geographic market in relation to issuer-facing services
            is likely to be national in scope, but the exact market definition can be left open
   (500)    The Commission found in Clearstream that securities issued in accordance with the
            law of a Member State are in practice kept in final custody with the respective CSD
            and that therefore there is practically no competition between different national
            CSDs for the deposit and final custody or safekeeping of securities.378 The

             Commission followed the same reasoning in DBAG/NYSE Euronext but ultimately
             left the market definition open,379 as the competitive assessment was considered to be
             the same regardless of the precise geographic definition of the relevant market.
             CSDR will facilitate cross-border issuance of securities and may lead to increased
             pan-European competition. However, the Commission agrees with the Notifying
             Parties that in the short term, the issuer-facing services will remain national in scope.
   (501)     In any event, the exact geographic market definition and, in particular, the question
             of whether the market for the provision of issuer-facing services is national in scope
             or broader can be left open for the purposes of this Decision as it does not affect the
             Commission's competitive assessment in relation to settlement and custody services.
   8.3.2.1.3. Investor-facing services: Whether settlement and custody services form part of the
             same market can be left open
   (502)     In Clearstream,380 the Commission indicated that post-trading transaction processing
             includes settlement but does not cover safekeeping or custody services. Nevertheless,
             it considered that custody is not entirely separate from settlement, as the latter only
             takes place in relation to those securities that are kept in custody.
   (503)     The market investigation shows that from the perspective of trading counterparties,
             settlement and custody are different services that cannot substitute for each other.381
             As analysed in Clearstream, custody services differ from settlement services: the
             need for the latter only arises where there is a securities transaction, whereas every
             owner of securities needs to have them physically or electronically kept in safe
             custody and managed or administered even in the absence of transactions. Despite
             the fact that custody service providers (in particular custodians) do not necessarily
             offer settlement themselves,382 there is a certain degree of supply-side
             substitutability383. This is because custody services are provided on the securities
             received through settlement.
   (504)     In any event, the question of whether settlement and custody services constitute
             separate markets can be left open for the purposes of this Decision, as it does not
             affect the Commission's competitive assessment in relation to settlement and custody
             services.
   8.3.2.1.4. Investor-facing services: International settlement and custody services do not form
             part of the same market as domestic services
   (505)     The Commission identified in previous cases related to custody services specifically
             the existence of different positioning and specialisations of custody service providers
             in the market (global custodians, custodians serving clients resident in specific
             countries, local custodians, etc.). The Commission considered on several occasions

             the following segments of intermediate custody services: (i) global custody and (ii)
             domestic (and sub-) custody services384, but left the exact market definition open.
   (506)     In Credit Agricole / Caisse d’Epargne / JV,385 the Commission looked into the
             possible existence of (i) a global market for global custody, (ii) an EEA-market for
             global custody, (iii) a market for custody services for clients resident in specific
             countries, and (iv) a national market for sub-custody (i.e. outsourcing of custody
             services with no direct link between the sub-custodian and the final customers).
   (507)     In State Street Corporation/Deutsche Bank,386 the Commission considered a
             potential segmentation between (i) global custody and (ii) domestic (or sub-) custody
             services, where the former was defined as a service provided to investment entities
             which own or manage investments from a variety of international markets, and the
             latter would be those which are provided to institutions and/or individual clients
             which require only "domestic assistance".
   (508)     In CDC/Banco Urquijo/JV387, the Commission considered (i) global custody services
             market, comprising services to investment institutions owning or managing
             securitised investments, (ii) domestic institutional custody services, comprising
             services destined to institutions which require only domestic services (asset
             managers, pension funds, broker dealers, etc.) and (iii) domestic retail custodian
             services, comprising custody of securities belonging to individual clients. The
             Commission analysed the latter two at national level but left the exact product and
             geographic market definition open.
   (509)     In the case at hand, the Notifying Parties are not as such custodians, but submit that
             they compete with custodians for settlement and custody services. Therefore, when
             analysing below the settlement and custody services, the Commission will assess
             whether custodians and (I)CSDs are part of the same market, in line with the
             Notifying Parties' submission. The results of the market investigation support the
             existence of different market segments.

   (511)     Second, the results of the market investigation indicate that the two ICSDs
             (Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking) and global custodians (in particular,
             Bank of New York Mellon ("BNYM" or "BNY Mellon") and JP Morgan) should be

           Commission considers the precedents cited above as indicative of the functioning of the markets for
           settlement and custody services, on which the Notifying Parties consider that they are in competition
           with custodians.

           distinguished from CSDs and local custodians, because they provide similar level of
           services, can handle assets issued in a large number of countries and serve customers
           active in various countries. On the contrary, national CSDs mostly or only serve
           assets issued in their country, and thus do not provide the same range of services, in
           the same breadth of countries of issuance and do not serve the same type of
           customers as ICSDs and global custodians.
   (512)   As a consequence, large international customers with activities covering a large
           portfolio of assets generally use custodians or ICSDs, as explained by one market
           participant: "Most of the market participants, including [X], are linked indirectly to
           CSDs through intermediaries (custodian banks or ICSDs, i.e. Euroclear or
           Clearstream). These intermediaries provide additional services compared to CSDs
           such as asset servicing, tax services, banking services (e.g. credit). ICSDs are a
           hybrid model as they provide similar services to those of CSDs and those of
           custodian banks."389 ICSDs also have a specific market positioning, as they hold the
           securities that custodians have on their books on behalf of other smaller custodians or
           customers. ICSDs thus act as service providers for smaller custodians.
   (513)   Some customers appear to mix the use of national CSDs for simple custody services
           (without the more sophisticated asset servicing offered by ICSDs or custodians) in
           countries where they have significant activities and use ICSDs or custodians for the
           rest of their activities: "A direct link to CSDs is also possible and can make sense if
           the amount of business is significant. In such cases [X] can do asset servicing
           itself."390 However, this possibility generally concerns customers which have
           sufficient business in the country considered and does not imply any substitutability
           between services provided by these different types of service providers. Switching
           from an ICSD or a large custodian to a CSD or local custodian might require
           customers to do themselves certain asset servicing previously outsourced to the
           custodian or ICSD In case these customers have activities in securities of various
           countries, it would require them to substitute one service provider (ICSD or
           custodian) with several national CSDs (or local custodians) which would not provide
           the same efficiency.
   (514)   Certain customers also distinguish between CSDs on the one hand, and custodians
           and ICSDs on the other hand because the former settle in central bank money and is
           thus less costly than settling in commercial bank money through custodians and
           ICSDs: "cash settlement takes place in central bank money […] allowing us to
           optimize our group’s liquidity and collateral. Settlement of repos taking place though
           custodians requires cash settlement to take place in commercial bank money
           subjecting us to funding risks and cost, usage of credit allocations of the custodians
           and possible collateral requirements to support the settlement volumes."391 This
           element adds to the difference in terms of services provided by ICSDs and CSDs.
   (515)   Therefore, the Commission concludes that, for the purposes of this Decision, ICSDs
           and global custodians, on the one hand, do not form part of the same product market
           as, on the other hand, national CSDs and other custodians for the provision of
           settlement and custody services.

   8.3.2.1.5. Investor-facing services: Whether international settlement and custody services
            provided by ICSDs on the one hand and global custodians on the other hand form
            separate markets can be left open
   (516)    As regards a potential distinction between ICSDs and global custodians, certain
            customers consider that (I)CSDs provide more secure custody arrangements than
            custodians: "Depository has larger oversight responsibilities for the assets held in
            comparison to the custodian."392 According to the post-trade processing service
            provider Euroclear, custodians and (I)CSDs also tend to have different clients: "The
            services of (I)CSDs are generally speaking rather standardised or "run of the mill",
            with an emphasis on automatic and straight-through processing, and simple
            reporting, whereas the offering of custodians is more tailor-made. As a consequence,
            clients of (I)CSDs tend to be sophisticated, large dealers or other large financial
            institutions. Custodians tend to offer additional services such as home-banking,
            investment advice or other services on the assets that they hold, which (I)CSDs do
            not."393
   (517)    In any event, the question of whether services provided by ICSDs and services
            provided by global custodians constitute separate markets can be left open for the
            purposes of this Decision, as it does not affect the Commission's competitive
            assessment in relation to settlement and custody services.
   8.3.2.1.6. Investor-facing services: The market for international settlement and custody
            services for fixed income form a separate market
   (518)    The results of the market investigation provided indications that the markets for
            settlement and custody could be split by type of assets. From a demand-side
            perspective, settlement for fixed income transactions and custody for fixed income
            securities are not substitutable with settlement for equities transactions and custody
            of equities. In addition, the market structure for settlement and custody services
            appears to differ between fixed income (bonds and repos) and equities. ICSDs are
            particularly strong with respect to fixed income business, whereas CSDs and
            custodian banks specialise in settlement and custody of equity-related transactions.
   (519)    BNY Mellon explains that "the two (I) CSDs are typically better connected to the
            fixed income desks of sell-side dealers due to their specialization in European fixed
            income securities and their connectivity to the European Central Bank."394 Euroclear
            also explains that "The entities providing post-clearing services differ across asset
            classes. Equities are mostly safekept and settled by national issuer CSDs and
            regional or global custodians." while "Government bonds and corporate bonds are
            initially issued in national CSDs, but the most popular and liquid of these are
            typically also held and settled at the level of the two ICSDs where large clients pool
            their assets and post-trading activity, along with the Eurobonds for which EB and
            CBL act as issuer CSD(s). It is therefore the ICSDs that perform most of the
            safekeeping, asset servicing and other ancillary services for high-quality fixed
            income securities for large financial intermediaries, and also the settlement of

   (520)   By way of illustration, [BUSINESS SECRETS] of the repos and bonds transactions
           cleared on LCH Ltd are settled in Euroclear Bank [BUSINESS SECRETS] and
           Clearstream Banking [BUSINESS SECRETS]. This figure reaches [BUSINESS
           SECRETS] when considering clearing members common to LCH.Clearnet and
           Eurex (i.e. large customers). Likewise, around [BUSINESS SECRETS] of the bond
           and repo transactions cleared on Eurex by clearing members common to
           LCH.Clearnet and Eurex are settled in Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking
           (bonds: [BUSINESS SECRETS] and [BUSINESS SECRETS], repos: [BUSINESS
           SECRETS] and [BUSINESS SECRETS]). This figure reaches [BUSINESS
           SECRETS] and [BUSINESS SECRETS] when considering clearing members
           common to LCH.Clearnet and Eurex.396 On the contrary, as regards equities, less
           than [BUSINESS SECRETS] of equities transactions cleared on LCH Ltd and
           [BUSINESS SECRETS] of equities transactions cleared on Eurex are settled in
           Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking; the [BUSINESS SECRETS] majority
           being thus settled in national CSDs.397
   (521)   This distinction is also identified in the Notifying Parties' internal documents. One
           internal document of DBAG states for example that "[BUSINESS SECRETS]".398

         The Notifying Parties indicate in their reply to the Statement of Objections (Part II), that only around
         half of the respondents to the questionnaire Q1 "Sell-side Customers", question 20 (on settlement,
         custody and CMS) and question 180 (on CMS) provided indications that providers of custody,
         settlement or collateral management services have certain specialisation by asset classes, which cannot
         be considered as providing a conclusive outcome, the Commission itself having considered in another
         instance where the response outcome was split in half that it cannot be considered a conclusive outcome
         (referring to paragraph 695 of the Statement of Objections). The Notifying Parties also consider that
         respondents to questionnaire Q11 "Sell-side Customers", question 120 did not make an appreciable
         differentiation by asset classes, despite the Commission’s specific request to do so, if relevant, and refer
         to general statements of competitors which indicate that they can provide settlement and custody
         services for all types of asset classes.
         First, the Commission considers on the contrary that the fact that a significant portion of customers
         spontaneously mention this specialisation in response to relatively open questions, is already a strong
         indication that different providers specialise by asset classes. Indeed, these responses reflect the
         Commission's assessment that the different types of providers are not necessarily excluded from given
         segments, but may only have limited positions in these segments.
         As regards the conclusiveness of mixed responses, the Commission actually considered in the instance
         the Notifying Parties refer to that the question was not conclusive on its own but considering all
         evidence together led the Commission to conclude that cleared and uncleared repos were not part of the
         same market. Similarly here, these replies to questionnaire Q1 "Sell-side Customers", question 20 (on
         settlement, custody and CMS) and question 180 (on CMS) were corroborated by responses from other
         market participants (such as Euroclear, BNY Mellon), settlement figures from the Notifying Parties'
         clearing houses and the Notifying Parties' internal documents.
         Second, while the Notifying Parties underline that the latter question (question 180) only refers to CMS
         and not to settlement and custody, market position in settlement, custody or CMS has a bearing on the
         position in the other services, because a number of customers buy them together.
   396
         The ratio is much smaller for repos cleared on Eurex and settled in Euroclear as Eurex is particularly
         strong in triparty repos for which the collateral management service provider has to be Clearstream.

   (522)    Finally, the Notifying Parties themselves in the Form CO indicate: "Over time, the
            ICSDs have built up a strong franchise on fixed income assets due to their primary
            role as “issuer-CSDs” for Eurobonds and the progressive extension of their
            networks of sub-custodians towards other European and non-European domestic
            CSDs for fixed income securities. Both, Euroclear and CBL, the two ICSDs, have
            fixed income securities as the vast majority of their assets under custody (i.e. equities
            account for less than 10% of assets under custody at CBL, the tri-party CMS agent.)
            By contrast, the two global custodians, JPM and BNYM, have developed superior
            asset servicing capabilities and larger networks of sub-depositories for equities."
   (523)    Therefore, the Commission concludes that for the purposes of this Decision, and
            similarly to the other levels of the value chain, a distinction should be drawn between
            settlement and custody services related to fixed income and settlement and custody
            services related to equities.
   8.3.2.1.7. Investor-facing services: The question of whether settlement for cleared fixed
            income transactions and settlement for uncleared fixed income transactions are
            separate markets can be left open
   (524)    As regards a potential distinction between cleared transactions and uncleared
            transactions, there appears to be limitations for custodians to provide settlement and
            thus custody services on the same terms as (I)CSDs. This is because settlement and
            custody service providers used by CCPs, including the Notifying Parties' CCPs, are
            CSDs or ICSDs. According to Euroclear, there are three main reasons for this: "(i)
            For risk and asset-protection-related reasons, the CCP will want to hold securities
            through an (I)CSD and not through a custodian which is usually a higher-risk entity;
            (ii) For reasons of risk and asset protection, under Art 47.3 EMIR the CCP must use
            a securities settlement system (which is basically an (I)CSD) for margining purposes,
            if an (I)CSD is available. If it is not, they must use another low-risk option as
            described in EMIR; (iii) Even in the absence of the above considerations, we
            understand that commercially it might be difficult for a CCP to require its members
            to use a particular custodian. It would be perceived as favouring one specific
            custodian over (I)CSDs which primary role is to hold securities and which are thus
            perceived as more natural or legitimate and therefore ‘neutral’ entities for providing
            custody service."399 This therefore limits the ability of custodians to compete for
            settlement and custody services related to cleared transactions. One global custodian
            also explains that they generally do not provide settlement services in relation to
            cleared transactions.400 The fact that custodians only settle uncleared transactions is
            confirmed by the Notifying Parties in their response to the Statement of Objections
            (Part II, paragraph 261). This means that there is at best one-way supply-side
            substitutability (from cleared to uncleared), thus custodians would not be able to
            constrain the merged entity for services related to cleared transactions.
   (525)    The Notifying Parties submit that the Statement of Objections is based on an unduly
            narrow market definition which ignores the fact that settlement and custody services
            can be provided on the basis of feeds of either cleared or uncleared trades, as well as
            on the basis of feeds from repos and bonds but also equity transactions, and that in
            this context, the input from LCH.Clearnet to Euroclear Bank's services is modest.

            They also consider that pricing is typically the same for both sources of transaction
            flow, and that uncleared transaction feeds are not less attractive for ICSDs than
            cleared transactions.
   (526)    The Notifying Parties however ignore the fact that settlement and custody services
            for cleared transactions are not substitutable with services for uncleared transactions
            from a demand-perspective. Likewise, for bonds and repos transactions as opposed to
            equity transactions. From a supply-side perspective, the fact that custodians do not
            provide services for cleared transactions, that ICSDs are the main service providers
            for fixed income transaction settlement while custodians are the main players in
            equity settlement transactions shows that it is not possible for a service provider to
            easily switch and expand from one segment to the other. According to the
            Commission guidelines on market definition, the different segments of a product can
            be grouped together, provided that most of the suppliers are able to offer and sell the
            various products immediately and without significant increases of costs. Supply-side
            substitutability should not entail any significant investments, strategic decisions or
            time delays, which would be the case for custodians to deal with cleared transactions
            and for CSDs to expand into fixed income transactions.401 This is among others due
            to strong network effects, which make that settling a given type of asset class in the
            place where most other customers (including CCPs for cleared transactions) more
            efficient as is explained in detail in Section 8.4.4.2.1.
   (527)    In any event, the question of whether settlement and custody services related to
            cleared transactions and settlement and custody services related to uncleared
            transactions constitute separate markets can be left open for the purposes of this
            Decision as it does not affect the Commission's competitive assessment in relation to
            settlement and custody services.
   8.3.2.1.8. Investor-facing services: Geographic market definition
   (528)    In DBAG/NYSE Euronext, the Commission left open the exact geographic market
            definition in relation to (secondary) settlement as it did not have an impact on the
            competitive assessment.402
   (529)    Global custodians and ICSDs are able to serve international customers in relation to a
            large variety of assets. For this purposes, they need to have the capabilities to serve
            securities issued in the various EEA countries, and thus to know and apply the
            specificities of national laws.403
   (530)    Therefore, the Commission concludes, for the purposes of this Decision, that ICSDs
            and global custodians compete for servicing European securities at least at EEA
            level.
   8.3.2.1.9. Conclusion on investor-facing services
   (531)    In view of the foregoing, for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission
            considers that the relevant market in relation to settlement and custody services for
            investors is the market for international settlement and custody services provided by

            ICSDs and global custodians in relation to EEA fixed income securities at least at
            EEA-level. .
   (532)    The question of whether a distinction should be drawn between services provided by
            global custodians and services provided by ICSDs can be left open for the purposes
            of this Decision, as it does not affect the Commission's competitive assessment in
            relation to settlement and custody services. In any event, for completeness, these
            differences will be taken into account in the competitive assessment.
   8.3.2.1.10. Conclusion on issuer-facing services
   (533)    For completeness, the Commission considers that issuer-facing services provided by
            CSDs and issuer-facing services provided ICSDs are likely to constitute separate
            markets, this question can be left open for the purposes of this Decision, as it does
            not affect the Commission's competitive assessment in relation to settlement and
            custody services.
   8.3.2.2. Collateral management
   (534)    In its previous decision on DBAG/NYSE Euronext,404 the Commission considered
            that collateral management services are provided independently of other post-trading
            services, and should therefore be regarded as a separate market. The Commission
            further contemplated whether collateral management services or CMS should be
            distinguished according to the specific infrastructure for which collateral needs to be
            provided, i.e. each CCP (that is to say each collateral pool). While CMS depend on
            the provision of specific transaction feeds, this was considered not to be decisive for
            the definition of the relevant market and accordingly, the precise market definition
            was left open.405 As regards the geographic scope of the market, the Commission
            contemplated both an EEA wide as well as a global market, but left the market
            definition open.
   (535)    It appears from the results of the market investigation that the ICSDs are particularly
            strong with respect to fixed income business, whereas custodian banks specialise in
            equities-related collateral management.406 One customer explains for example that
            "The main CMS providers in the fixed-income (corporate and sovereign bonds) field
            are Euroclear and Clearstream. There is strong competition between those two
            providers. They have historically been the "home" for fixed income product triparty
            business, and others triparty providers have not made much inroads to date.", while
            "The main collateral management services providers in the equities field are BNY
            Mellon and JP Morgan, whereas Clearstream only has a small equity activity. The
            reason for their strong position as regards equities lies in their superior capabilities
            in this regard as compared to others."407 In addition, JP Morgan and BNY Mellon
            are active to a certain extent in collateral management for repos for example, but
            only for uncleared transactions.408

   (536)   BNY Mellon and Euroclear explain that custodian banks could not provide CMS
           services with respect to cleared transactions, indicating that regulation (Article 47.3
           of EMIR409) would require, or at least favour, CCPs to hold collateral in CSDs.410
           Article 47.3 of EMIR provides that it is for the CCP to decide where collateral it
           requests should be held. It also provides that collateral should be held in (I)CSDs or
           equivalent highly secured arrangements. As CCPs would likely favour arrangements
           considered the most secure, i.e. ICSDs or CSDs, Euroclear and Clearstream are best
           placed to provide collateral management for securities used in cleared transactions
           (derivatives, repos, etc.).411 This was also mentioned by the Notifying Parties in the
           Form CO which indicate that "all tri-party CMS agents offer a comprehensive
           portfolio of services. However, there are two exceptions to this rule: (a) CCP
           Margining in Europe due to EMIR requirements must be done through a SSS/CSD,
           therefore European CCPs do not accept margin collateral through BNYM and JPM
           tri-party CMS services, but exclusively through (I)CSDs. (b) In the Eurozone and due
           to ECB-requirements, the ECB and all related Eurozone National Central Banks
           only accept to receive EUR collateral through SSS in the Eurozone. BNYM and JPM
           are therefore not eligible as collateral depository. National Central Banks only use
           tri-party agents which are at the same time SSSs, such as Euroclear, Clearstream,
           Monte Titoli, Iberclear."412
   (537)   The distinction between collateral management for cleared transactions vs uncleared
           transactions is also evidenced by the fact that certain large customers (such as
           Natixis, Commerzbank or Bank of America Merrill Lynch) indicate managing their
           collateral in-house in case of uncleared transactions contrary to cleared transactions,
           in particular for repo transactions.413
   (538)   Similarly to settlement and custody services, ICSDs and global custodians appear to
           serve different categories of clients than CSDs and local custodians in relation to
           collateral management.
   (539)   Competition exists between CMS providers in order to attract customers.
   (540)   Therefore, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of this Decision, a
           separate market for CMS should be considered. The question of whether CMS are
           specific to given financial instruments and the question of whether in relation to
           some instruments such as derivatives CMS are specific to the connected
           infrastructure, can be left open for the purposes of this Decision, as it does not affect
           the Commission's assessment in relation to collateral management.

   8.3.2.3. Geographic market definition
   (541)     As for the geographic scope of the market, respondents to the market investigation
             generally indicated that they rely on CMS providers with activities in the EEA.414 In
             addition, their ability to be competitive is also based on the efficiencies they provide
             to customers. More specifically, it is more efficient for customers to trade with
             counterparties using the same service provider in order to avoid moving securities
             from a service provider to another, which means that they cannot easily switch from
             a CMS provider active in the EEA to a CMS provider which would be active in other
             world regions. Transactions can indeed be settled quickly and at lower cost if a
             sufficient number of customers use the same service provider.
   (542)     Therefore, the Commission concludes, for the purposes of this Decision, that CMS
             providers compete at EEA level.
   8.3.2.4. Conclusion on relevant market
   (543)     In view of the foregoing, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of this
             Decision, the relevant market in relation to collateral management is the EEA market
             for CMS. The question of whether the market for CMS should be further segmented
             on the basis of a potential distinction between international providers (ICSDs and
             global custodians) vs domestic providers (CSDs and local custodians), a potential
             distinction between collateral management services for cleared transactions vs
             collateral management services for uncleared transactions, and a potential distinction
             between collateral management of fixed income vs collateral management of equities
             can be left open for the purposes of this Decision, as it does not affect the
             Commission's competitive assessment in relation to CMS.
   8.4.      Competitive assessment
   (544)     In this section, the Commission will only assess the impact of the Transaction on (i)
             international settlement and custody for fixed income provided by ICSDs and global
             custodians, and (ii) collateral management, because these are the only post-trade
             services, for which it concludes that the Transaction would lead to a significant
             impediment to effective competition.
   8.4.1.    Foreclosure of post-trade service providers, and in particular Clearstream's closest
             competitor Euroclear
   (545)     In the Statement of Objections, the Commission preliminarily identified two
             competition issues arising from the vertical link between DBAG's activities (Eurex)
             and LSEG's activities (LCH.Clearnet in particular) in clearing of bonds and clearing
             of ATS traded and CCP cleared non triparty and triparty repos and two downstream
             markets where DBAG's Clearstream is active. On the one hand, concerns were raised
             in relation to international settlement and custody services for fixed income products,
             and on the other hand, in relation to collateral management activities.
   (546)     Euroclear, which is DBAG's main competitor in the area of settlement, custody and
             collateral management, has raised concerns that the Transaction may lead to the
             merged entity foreclosing it from the market.

   (547)   Following the opening of the procedure, two meetings between Euroclear and the
           Commission took place in order for the Commission to refine its understanding of
           Euroclear's concern, which is summarised in the following paragraphs.
   (548)   The Commission has analysed the complaint of Euroclear, and considers that the
           Transaction would ultimately significantly weaken it as a significant competitive
           force closely competing with Clearstream, specifically in relation to international
           settlement and custody for EEA fixed income instruments, and as a consequence, in
           the market for collateral management in the EEA. As analysed in Sections 6.3 and
           7.3, the merged entity would be able to exercise a significant market power on the
           upstream markets for clearing of bonds, ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos
           and ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos. As a result, together with the
           weakening of Euroclear on these markets, and the absence of other credible
           competitors able to exercise an effective competitive constraint on the merged entity,
           the Commission considers that the Transaction would lead to a significant
           impediment to effective competition on the market for international services for
           settlement and custody in relation to fixed income and on the market for collateral
           management to the detriment of customers. As set out below, the Commission
           considers that such harm would manifest itself through degraded service efficiency, a
           reduction in the quality of services and cost increases in particular in relation to
           international services for settlement and custody in relation to fixed income
           instruments, as well as collateral management services, to the detriment of
           customers.
   8.4.2.  Euroclear's concern
   (549)   Euroclear claims that it is one of the two (principal) ICSDs in Europe, the other
           being Clearstream.415 Euroclear provides services that can be broadly categorised as
           follows: settlement, custody/safekeeping (asset protection) and CMS.
   (550)   Euroclear submits that Euroclear and Clearstream are geared towards large,
           international dealer banks, who wish to have one provider that keeps all or most of
           their (fixed income) securities. They are both able to service securities from various
           countries, contrary to national CSDs. Smaller companies (focused on national
           markets) on the contrary tend to use the national CSD for their national activities and
           an agent or custodians in case they trade securities of other countries.
   (551)   In Euroclear's view, one of the key differences between them is that Clearstream is
           vertically integrated, i.e. also offers trading and clearing services, whereas Euroclear
           is not. Clearstream's vertical integration entails that customers trading on its
           platforms are (with only limited exceptions) obliged to use Clearstream for
           settlement.
   (552)   Specifically, Euroclear is concerned that the combination of DBAG's Eurex and
           Clearstream with LSEG's LCH.Clearnet would provide ability and incentives for the
           merged entity to divert to Clearstream trade flows cleared by LCH.Clearnet
           (primarily repo transactions) and currently settled by Euroclear after the merger. This
           diversion of trade feeds would lead to increased costs for Euroclear's customers due
           in particular to higher settlement costs. In addition, Euroclear claims that
           LCH.Clearnet will have the ability and incentive to require customers to put
   415
          [BUSINESS SECRETS].
EN                                                 103                                              EN

         collateral currently deposited at Euroclear in Clearstream. Euroclear alleges that in
         addition to raising customers' costs and Euroclear's costs, such a foreclosure strategy
         might lead to a "tipping" of the market in DBAG's favour even if only a partial
         foreclosure strategy were applied due to network effects and economies of
         consolidation on the client side.
   (553) Following the integration of LCH.Clearnet into a combined group, Euroclear expects
         that the Notifying Parties would have the ability and incentive to divert the
         transaction feeds that Euroclear currently receives from LCH.Clearnet to Clearstream
         in respect of settlement of CCP-cleared repo and equity trades. The impact would be
         more particularly significant in the repo market where Eurex and LCH.Clearnet are
         the only CCPs and because repo transactions are settlement-intensive. Similarly,
         LCH.Clearnet would require margin, in particular for OTC interest rate swaps and
         listed derivatives, to be posted in Clearstream.
   (554) For customers having their securities in Euroclear, a diversion of transaction feeds
         would increase the instances in which transactions entail external or cross-system
         settlement (i.e. where the two parties to a trade have not appointed the same
         settlement and custody service provider and the traded security has to "cross"
         between two different systems, see detailed description in Section 8.4.4.2.1.) which
         is by definition more costly. This in turn would make them move their securities to
         Clearstream, and most likely all their securities as customers tend to single-home or
         at least consolidate most of their securities with one service provider. Due to network
         effects (i.e. lower cost to transact with customers having the same settlement,
         custody and collateral management service provider), other customers would likely
         follow.
   (555) As a result, Euroclear considers that it would be a much weakened competitive force
         and that it could not continue to offer the same price and services to its customers as
         it does today.
   (556) This is first because according to Euroclear, the Transaction would lead to increased
         costs for customers. Clients would experience reduced settlement efficiency, as
         cross-system settlement is more costly than internal settlement and does not occur
         real-time. Euroclear indicates that it currently charges € 0.50 on average per internal
         instruction and € 1.5 on average for cross-system instruction between Euroclear
         Bank and Clearstream Banking, which reflects the cost difference on the side of the
         ICSD. Cross-system settlement also leads to a lower rate of instructions fulfilled on
         contractual settlement date (94% between Euroclear's and Clearstream's ICSDs as
         opposed to 99% for internal settlement) and a higher rate of failed settlement (8-10%
         as opposed to 3%) which leads for customers to an opportunity cost of not using the
         asset in other activities and to late settlement penalties imposed in the context of
         CSD Regulation. Cross-system instructions are only sent for settlement if Euroclear
         Bank client has sufficient cash or credit. This is in contrast to internal instructions
         which are executed in real time. There is an incremental cost to the client to secure
         this cash or intra-day credit: as the liquid assets need to be mobilised and reserved,
         the client has an opportunity cost of not being able to use these assets elsewhere (as
         collateral or in the securities lending program).
   (557) Second, Euroclear's decreased revenues would have to sustain high fixed costs
         common to the industry.
EN                                              104                                              EN

   (558)    Third, Euroclear submits that it would face an increased cost due to the need to
            expand its credit line to accommodate the increase in cross-system settlement
            volumes.
   (559)    Ultimately, this would reduce the competitive constraint on Clearstream which then
            could increase prices for the customers it has won over.
   (560)    In Euroclear's view, the open access obligations of the CSDR and T2S project do not
            solve this concern. First, there is no legal requirement for CCPs to offer their
            customers a choice between different CSDs in which to deposit margins transferred
            to the CCP. Second, the CSDR provides a conditional right of access to a transaction
            feed, and it is by no means certain if a CCP unwilling to grant access could be forced
            to do so, and if so, how quickly. In addition, at the moment of submission, the exact
            conditions to refuse access were not yet defined, as the RTSs were not adopted
            yet.416 As regards T2S, its scope will not cover certain transactions (i.e. only eligible
            euro-denominated securities that can be settled in central bank money). According to
            Euroclear, T2S will not be fully operational in the near future, the full benefits of
            T2S not being expected until after 2018.
   8.4.3.    Notifying Parties' views
   (561)    According to the Notifying Parties, the merged entity will not have the ability to
            foreclose Euroclear from the settlement, custody and collateral management markets.
   (562)    The Notifying Parties first submit that Euroclear is not solely dependent on trade
            feeds from LCH.Clearnet in order to provide settlement and custody services, and
            that this is thus impossible to argue that Euroclear would be foreclosed from access
            to an indispensable input. Second, for assets for which Euroclear is the issuer CSD,
            there could be no foreclosure in any event, since Euroclear is the primary settlement
            location for such securities. Third, equity, bond, repos and derivatives trades cleared
            by rival CCPs and / or OTC trades will continue to provide significant sources of
            transaction feeds to Euroclear.
   (563)    The Notifying Parties further submit that the merged entity will not have the ability
            to foreclose Euroclear from the collateral management market due to the relatively
            small amount of collateral posted to the Notifying Parties' CCPs.
   (564)    In relation to both custody and collateral management, the Notifying Parties also
            submit in their response to the Decision opening the proceedings that customers
            generally are "multi-homing" (i.e. maintain securities both in Clearstream and
            Euroclear) and have substantial accounts both at Euroclear and Clearstream for
            sound risk management, asset diversification, price comparison and to allow for a
            better position in fee negotiations.
   (565)    According to the Notifying Parties, the merged entity would not have the incentive to
            foreclose Euroclear either. First, the Notifying Parties consider that trading and
            clearing volume would divert to third party trading venues if customers were forced
   416
          The Commission adopted the RTS on authorisation, supervisory and operational requirements for
          central securities depositories on 11 November 2016 specifying the conditions to refuse access in
          Article 89 therein. See Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/392 of 11 November 2016
          supplementing Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council with
          regard to regulatory technical standards on authorisation, supervisory and operational requirements for
          central securities depositories (OJ L 65, 10.3.2017, p. 48–115).

          to settle at Clearstream. Second, the absence of an incentive for the merged entity to
          foreclose Euroclear is also demonstrated by the fact that DBAG allows settlement in
          Euroclear for certain trades that are cleared in Eurex (namely Irish Stock Exchange's
          trade flows cleared at Eurex, and certain trades cleared at Eurex Bonds and Eurex
          Repos for which the Notifying Parties however submitted in the response to the
          Decision opening the proceedings that the exact split across the different CSDs was
          not available). Third, LCH.Clearnet would harm its commercial reputation by not
          complying with its open access policy and expose itself to retaliation from customers
          in all areas of LSEG's activities.
   (566)  Moreover, the Notifying Parties submit that a foreclosure strategy would be
          prevented by the open access regulations in the CSDR.
   (567)  Finally, the Notifying Parties submit that there would be no appreciable impact on
          competition even in the event of a foreclosure strategy. First, they submit that fees
          for final custody, which would be unaffected by a foreclosure, account for the largest
          part of Euroclear's revenues. Similarly and second, the merged entity could only try
          to replace Euroclear as secondary settlement location, since the primary settlement
          location is not determined by the trading venue or the clearing house but by the
          issuer of each instrument. Third, Euroclear accounts for the bulk of equity trades
          originating from LSEG trading/clearing venues which are settled in a third party
          CSD; a perfect foreclosure strategy would merely replace one monopolist with
          another or increase bundle to bundle competition (EuroCCP and SIX together with
          Euroclear on the one hand, LSE, Eurex and LCH, together with Clearstream on the
          other hand). Fourth, while the Notifying Parties recognise the existence of network
          effects and economies of scale, they consider that Euroclear will retain a significant
          volume of assets under custody and very substantial trade feeds and that a marginal
          shift of settlement and custody activity is unlikely to make Euroclear exit the market,
          as Clearstream has always been smaller than Euroclear and has remained on the
          market.
   8.4.4. Commission's assessment
   (568)  The Commission's analysis in this section is structured as follows.
          <U+F0B7>      Section 8.4.4.1 considers the analytical framework applicable to vertical
                 relationships.
          <U+F0B7>      Section 8.4.4.2.1 explains that the merged entity would have the ability to
                 divert cleared fixed income transaction feeds to Clearstream, because i) cleared
                 repo transaction feeds are important inputs for international settlement and
                 custody services in relation to fixed income, ii) the merged entity would have
                 the ability to divert cleared fixed income settlement feeds to Clearstream, and
                 to introduce cross-system settlement for settlement taking place at competitors,
                 which is more costly and less efficient for customers than internal settlement.
          <U+F0B7>      Section 8.4.4.2.2 explains that the merged entity would have the incentive to
                 foreclose access to important inputs for settlement and custody services for
                 EEA fixed income provided by ICSDs and global custodians, because diverting
                 cleared repo transaction feeds i) would degrade the service quality and cost
                 level of competitors, ii) will increase its revenues downstream without harming
                 its revenues upstream.

            <U+F0B7>      Section 8.4.4.2.3 shows that the merger would impede effective competition in
                   the markets for settlement and custody for fixed income provided by ICSDs
                   and global custodians.
            <U+F0B7>      Section 8.4.4.2.4 explains that neither T2S nor the CSDR would prevent the
                   harm that would result from the Transaction.
            <U+F0B7>      Section 8.4.4.3.1 explains that the merged entity would have the ability to
                   foreclose access to important inputs for collateral management, because i)
                   cleared repo transaction feeds are an important input for collateral
                   management, ii) CCPs can determine where collateral/margin is to be
                   deposited.
            <U+F0B7>      Section 8.4.4.3.2 explains that the merged entity would have the incentive to
                   foreclose access to important inputs for collateral management
            <U+F0B7>      Section 8.4.4.3.3 shows that the merger would lead to a significant impediment
                   to effective competition in the markets for collateral management
   8.4.4.1. Applicable legal framework regarding vertical foreclosure
   (569)    The Commission's Guidelines on the assessment of non-horizontal mergers set out
            the framework of analysis in the context of vertical mergers: "A merger is said to
            result in foreclosure where actual or potential rivals' access to supplies or markets is
            hampered or eliminated as a result of the merger, thereby reducing these companies'
            ability and/or incentive to compete." The Guidelines describe the potential negative
            effects of foreclosure on the process of competition: "Such foreclosure may
            discourage entry or expansion of rivals or encourage their exit. Foreclosure thus can
            be found even if the foreclosed rivals are not forced to exit the market: It is sufficient
            that the rivals are disadvantaged and consequently led to compete less effectively.",
            and the ultimate negative effect on customers: "Such foreclosure is regarded as anti-
            competitive where the merging companies — and, possibly, some of its competitors
            as well — are as a result able to profitably increase the price charged to
            consumers."
   (570)    Two forms of foreclosure can arise: restriction of access to an important input (input
            foreclosure) or restriction of access to a sufficient customer base (customer
            foreclosure).
   (571)    In the case at hand, the Notifying Parties are active in several clearing markets, in
            particular in the markets for clearing of repos and of bonds, but also clearing for
            equities and various categories of derivatives (among others ETD interest rate
            derivatives and OTC interest rate derivatives). Transaction feeds provided by CCPs
            to CSDs and ICSDs (and potentially custodians) are used as input in order to provide
            settlement and custody services, as well as collateral management services.
   (572)    In addition, CCPs provide collateral feeds to CSD/ICSDs through margin
            requirements in various types of transactions and in particular in derivative and repo
            transactions.

   8.4.4.2. Assessment related to the market for international settlement and custody services in
             relation to fixed income
   8.4.4.2.1. The merged entity would have the ability to divert cleared fixed income transaction
             feeds to Clearstream
   8.4.4.2.1.1. Cleared repo transaction feeds are important inputs for international settlement
             and custody services in relation to fixed income
   (573)     In order to analyse a potential input foreclosure, once the downstream markets
             concerned are identified, it should be analysed whether the input at stake is an
             important input,417 such that a restriction of access or increased prices can have a
             detrimental effect on the ability of downstream companies to compete. In the case at
             hand, the question is to identify the input that is used by competitors of the Notifying
             Parties in order to provide international settlement and custody services for fixed
             income.
   (574)     From a general point of view, CSDs, ICSDs and custodians provide settlement and
             custody services on the basis of (i) the duty given by customers to (electronically)
             hold assets in custody and provide asset servicing and (ii) transaction feeds they
             receive either (a) from customers directly (for uncleared transactions) or (b) from
             CCPs in case of cleared transactions.418
   (575)     More specifically, on the market for international settlement and custody services
             related to fixed income, ICSDs and global custodians provide settlement and custody
             services on the basis of fixed income transaction feeds received from CCPs.
   (576)     As explained in Section 7.2.2.3.2, cleared repo transactions are particularly used by
             large banks or dealers that engage in many, often short term, repo transactions and
             gain significant benefits from using a CCP. Because of the higher frequency and the
             particularly short duration of these transactions, the settlement efficiency is
             particularly important for customers using cleared repo transactions. The ability to
             influence settlement efficiency for cleared repo transactions can thus have a
             significant impact for customers and in turn on the ability of settlement service
             providers to compete.
   (577)     In addition, large customers also engage in uncleared transactions with non-dealer
             customers and try to aggregate their securities with one service provider for a more
             efficient handling of their securities. The decision of cleared repo customers

           concentrations between undertakings, OJ C 265, 18 October 2008, p.6 ("Non-horizontal Merger
           Guidelines"), paragraph 34.
   418
           According to the data submitted by the Notifying Parties, cleared non-triparty repo transactions
           represented around [30-40%] (i.e. EUR [BUSINESS SECRETS] notional outstanding volumes) in 2015
           out of the total of non-triparty repos including uncleared transactions (EUR [BUSINESS SECRETS]).
           With regard to non-triparty repo transactions, cleared transactions represented around [20-30%] (i.e.
           EUR [BUSINESS SECRETS] notional outstanding volumes) in 2015 out of the total of non-triparty
           repos including uncleared transactions (EUR [BUSINESS SECRETS]). With regard to bond
           transactions, cleared transactions represented around [10-20%] (i.e. EUR [BUSINESS SECRETS]
           notional outstanding volumes) in 2015 out of the total of non-triparty repos including uncleared
           transactions. (Source: Form CO, Annexes M.7995_DBAG_LSEG_RFI_10_Annex_06_Market share

         regarding their location for settlement of cleared repos is thus likely to have an
         impact on their uncleared repo transactions as well as their counterparties. Indeed, it
         is generally beneficial for customers to trade with counterparties that have the same
         settlement and custody service provider for a better efficiency. Cleared repo
         transaction feeds are thus more important than the mere share they represent in the
         total repo market.
   (578) It should also be noted that CCPs are not one customer out of many for settlement
         and custody services, but have a central role in the transaction processes. They are
         indeed the focal point of all trading counterparties willing to benefit from CCP
         clearing advantages and their decisions can have a much more significant impact on
         the market than any customer.
   (579) The Notifying Parties submit that the Statement of Objections is based on an unduly
         narrow market definition which ignores the fact that settlement and custody services
         (as well as CMS) can be provided on the basis of feeds of either cleared or uncleared
         trades, as well as on the basis of feeds from repos and bonds but also equity
         transactions, and that in this context, the input from LCH.Clearnet to Euroclear
         Bank's services is modest.
   (580) More specifically, the Notifying Parties claim that the importance of cleared repo
         transaction feeds is overstated and that it should not constitute an important input for
         downstream customers, because cleared repo transaction feeds represent
         approximately 30% of outstanding repos by value in the EEA and for a minority of
         repo trade feeds settled at Euroclear Bank (less than 25%).
   (581) The Notifying Parties in addition submit that the significance of LCH.Clearnet's
         specific trade feeds is overstated in the Statement of Objections, because there is no
         reason to believe that LCH.Clearnet's feeds are critical to the provision of settlement,
         custody and collateral management by Euroclear Bank, considering that the feeds
         that Euroclear Bank obtains from uncleared trades account for the majority (75%-
         100%) of trade feeds settled at Euroclear Bank. According to the Notifying Parties,
         LCH.Clearnet is just one of many other counterparties in repo trades. The loss of
         LCH.Clearnet's trade feeds would thus not materially impair Euroclear Bank's offer.
   (582) The Commission has however defined a market for settlement and custody for fixed
         income transactions provided by ICSDs and large custodians, and left open whether
         services for cleared and uncleared transactions are part of the same market. Indeed,
         the Commission considers that cleared repo transactions are an important input for
         the downstream market irrespective of the conclusion on this point.
   (583) In addition, settlement and custody services related to bonds and repos transactions
         are not substitutable with services related to equity transactions, as explained in
         Section 8.3.2.1.6 above. Therefore, if a service provider receives bond or repo
         transaction feeds in order to provide settlement and custody services, it cannot fulfil
         the same customer demand by replacing it by an equity transaction feed. In addition,
         contrary to the Parties claim, it is not immediate for a settlement and custody service
         provider for equities to easily expand in fixed income. [BUSINESS SECRETS].
   (584) The Commission also considers, as explained above, that the fact that cleared repos
         and bonds transactions count for a minority of the total repos and bonds transactions
         does not represent their actual importance in the provision of international settlement
         and custody services for fixed income, due to their potential impact on uncleared

             repos and bonds transactions, and on the choice of settlement and custody location of
             smaller customers.
   (585)     As regards the importance of LCH.Clearnet's feeds, as explained above,
             LCH.Clearnet has a central position on the market because of its role as a CCP. First,
             a CCP concentrates inter-dealer trades. By having this focal position for large
             customers, decisions taken by a CCP (for example as to where to maintain or open
             accounts) can have an impact on all its counterparties. An impact on large customers'
             decisions which are the main users of cleared repo transactions, in chain, can also
             impact decision-making of smaller customers. In addition, cleared repo transactions
             are often short term and frequent transactions, and are thus particularly important for
             dealer banks. These transactions can be used for example to avoid having a short
             position at the end of the day, and thus avoid bearing the cost of such short position:
             avoiding failed or delayed settlement is thus particularly important for such type of
             transactions. The fact that customers try to single-home their securities also implies
             that LCH.Clearnet can impact behaviour of customers beyond cleared transactions.
             CCPs cannot therefore be considered as "just one of many other counterparties in
             repo trades".
   (586)     Therefore, the Commission concludes that cleared fixed income (in particular repo)
             transaction feeds are an important input for the supply of international custody and
             settlement in relation to fixed income.
   8.4.4.2.1.2. The merged entity would have the ability to divert cleared fixed income
             settlement feeds to Clearstream and to introduce cross-system settlement for
             settlement taking place at competitors, which is more costly and less efficient for
             customers than internal settlement
   (587)     As described above, in Sections 6.2 and 7.2.2, in the upstream markets (CCP clearing
             of bonds, ATS traded and cleared non-triparty repos and ATS traded and cleared
             triparty repos), the merged entity would have de facto monopolies, and thus market
             power on these markets.
   (588)     In the downstream market (international settlement and custody services for fixed
             income), the merged entity would own Clearstream Banking, which is together with
             Euroclear Bank one of the only two ICSDs in the EEA.419 The other players on the
             market are global custodians, in particular JP Morgan and BNY Mellon.
   (589)     The merged entity's CCPs provide cleared fixed income feeds to third parties. This is
             in particular the case for LCH Ltd, while Eurex does not provide the possibility to
             settle outside Clearstream (triparty repos) or provide very limited volumes to third
             parties ([BUSINESS SECRETS] of Eurex' bonds and triparty repos volumes are
             settled at Euroclear). LCH SA and CC&G also very much operate in closed silos in
             cooperation with national CSDs for specific bonds (French, Spanish and Italian fixed
             income).420
   419
           LSEG also owns the ICSD globeSettle but it is a very small player at the moment.

           - as regards bonds and non-triparty repos, LCH Ltd provides [BUSINESS SECRETS] of its feeds to
           Euroclear, [BUSINESS SECRETS] to Clearstream's ICSD and [BUSINESS SECRETS] to
           Clearstream's national CSD; LCH SA provides feeds to LSEG's Monte Titoli and Euroclear; CC&G
           only provides feeds to Monte Titoli;

   (590)   The principal element of a foreclosure strategy of the merged entity resides in its
           ability to divert cleared fixed income transaction feeds421 to Clearstream. CCPs have
           indeed a key role in deciding where a given transaction is settled, because a bond
           used in a repo transaction has to pass by the CCP's account held by the provider the
           CCP has appointed for this service. The bond is taken from the account of the first
           counterparty, deposited to the CCP account, then moved to the account of the second
           counterparty. Each of these three counterparties can appoint its own service provider.
           However, the fact that the CCP does not use the same service provider as its trading
           counterparties has a direct bearing on the settlement efficiency and cost. We thus
           describe in more detail in the following paragraphs how this "cross-system"
           settlement occurs in practice and their implications, and in a second step, the
           importance of the CCP's role in the settlement process.
   (591)   Settlement can occur in two ways: if both counterparties to a trade appointed the
           same settlement and custody service provider (i.e. custodian, ICSD, or CSD) at
           which the type of security at stake should be held, settlement occurs internally,
           within the books of the same provider (this is referred to as "internal settlement"). As
           a result, even if that CSD is not the issuer CSD, and even though the security that is
           traded changes owners, the change in ownership is only registered in the books of
           that CSD, ICSD or custodian. The process is accordingly simple and cheap.
   (592)   If both counterparties do not have an account with the same provider or have not
           appointed the same custody service provider for the type of security involved in the
           transaction, in contrast, the settlement instructions have to cross different
           (settlement) systems; this is referred to as cross-system settlement or external
           settlement. This can occur for example because one of them does not have an
           account with the same (I)CSD or custodian as the other party or because for a given
           type of security, they do not have the same service provider. Two or more systems
           need to send settlement instructions, which imply both higher fees and delays422.
         - as regards triparty repos, settlement and collateral management services are provided by one service
         provider only: Clearstream for Eurex product (GC Pooling), Euroclear for LCH.Clearnet products
         (Term £ GC and € GC Plus) and Monte Titoli for CC&G product (X-COM).
         The Notifying Parties in their response to the Statement of Objections claim that the Statement of
         Objections does not consistently distinguish between CSDs and ICSDs, referring the paragraph citing
         the figures mentioned above for example. This is a misrepresentation of the Statement of Objections'
         arguments as shown by this paragraph, which simply indicates that CCPs are linked to several (I)CSDs,
         including national CSDs. This has no bearing on the fact that ICSDs and CSDs are not part of the same
         market, as explained in Section 8.3. on market definition.
   421
         In this context, the Commission notes that in the response to the Decision opening the proceedings, the
         Notifying Parties have in particular focused on the alleged inability of the combined entity to foreclose
         Euroclear from settlement instructions pertaining to equities trades. The Commission however did not
         consider a potential foreclosure in relation to equities in the Statement of Objections, as most of these
         securities appear to be held to a large extent either with custodians or in national CSDs, as explained in
         Section 8.3.2.1.6.

   (593)     Market participants identified the operational risks (such as failed settlement), time
             delays (as cross-system settlement requires more instruction exchanges across
             systems, does not necessarily occur real-time and may be subject to different cut-off
             times after which settlement between two systems cannot occur) and additional costs
             resulting from external settlement as a significant disadvantage of external settlement
             as compared to internal settlement.423 One market participant explains for example
             that "generally speaking, in addition to the additional costs related to external
             settlement, there is a higher degree of operational risk in moving the securities from
             another settlement system in time".424
   (594)     Several reports of the European Central Bank underline the importance of same-day
             settlement procedures in particular in relation to the repo market ("The European
             repo market is evolving towards more transactions with same-day settlement. One of
             the main drivers for same-day settlement is treasury management, which
             increasingly relies on DVP processes. The increased use of CCP clearing and
             related fulfilment of margin requirements also requires efficient same-day

          frequent users, the risk of settlement delay and failure is thus particularly problematic
          for such transactions.
   (595)  It follows from the above that, should LCH.Clearnet have the ability to increase
          cross-system settlements, it would in turn have the ability to increase settlement costs
          for Euroclear's customers. This holds true irrespective of the exact market definition
          in relation to settlement and custody, since by increasing the cost of the securities
          inflow, the merged entity has the ability to increase the costs or degrade the service
          level at which competitors can hold these securities (i.e. custody services).
   (596)  The following paragraphs will analyse the ability of the CCP to introduce cross-
          system settlement and more generally divert settlement feeds, and the impact it can
          have on the choice of settlement and custody locations by customers.
   (597)  The CCP, as one of the counterparties to the trade, can decide to hold accounts at
          specific service providers. CCPs can decide to open, maintain or close accounts with
          specific (I)CSDs and custodians. [BUSINESS SECRETS]427
   (598)  As one of the counterparties to the trade, it can also decide to settle its "leg" of given
          transactions at specific service providers. Securities must thus pass by the account of
          the CCP before being delivered to the receiving counterparty, and provides the CCP
          with a central role in the settlement process: "By way of background, it should be
          noted that, for cleared repo trades, the CCP itself is a party in the settlement
          process, as the transfer of securities from seller to buyer must pass through an
          account held by the CCP in a CSD (and, therefore, the transfer is not direct between
          the CSD accounts or intermediary custodian accounts of the seller and buyer). This
          fact gives the CCP a critical influence over the settlement venue."428 A CCP can thus
          introduce cross-system settlement for its trading counterparties.
   (599)  Internal documents of LSEG also confirm the important or even decisive role of
          CCPs in the choice of the venue where transactions are settled. [BUSINESS
          SECRETS]429 [BUSINESS SECRETS]430.
   (600)  Also, [BUSINESS SECRETS]. This again shows that CCPs have a key role in
          shaping the post-trade processing landscape by choosing with which service provider
          they decide to be linked.
   (601)  In any event, contrary to the Notifying Parties' claim, the fact that customers could
          still have the possibility to choose where to settle their transaction leg does not
          prevent CCPs from having an impact on the settlement location customers would
          choose. The merged entity's CCPs would indeed still be able to decide where
          securities have to be deposited for its settlement leg (i.e. the CCP, as one trading
          counterparty, also provides or receives a security that has to be deposited in a
          settlement service provider), which would have an impact on the costs to be paid by
          its counterparty to the trade and the risk of delay and failed settlement, and would
          thus influence customers' choice of settlement service provider.

   (602)   The results of the market investigation support the fact that the CCP can decide not
           only on the location of its settlement leg and introduce cross-system settlement but
           can decide more generally where settlement has to occur; the current functioning of
           triparty repos where services are provided by a given CCP together with a given
           ICSD is an example of this, but responses to the market investigation go beyond
           triparty repos: "The CCP decides formally and practically about the settlement
           venue."431; "for any CCP-Cleared instrument, be it an equity transaction, a bond
           transaction, a repo transaction, a securities lending transaction or the physical
           delivery of a derivatives transaction – it is the CCP that determines which settlement
           locations have to be used."432 CCPs are thus perceived as having a decisive role in
           the settlement location choice by market participants.
   (603)   Beyond the ability to induce cross-system settlement by diverting its settlement leg,
           the diversion of transaction feeds is further facilitated because customers do not
           necessarily express a preference as to where their transactions should be settled when
           they have several settlement service providers or track where their numerous
           transactions are settled.433 CCPs have powers of attorney from their customers. By
           this mean they can access the accounts held by customers at (I)CSDs or
           custodians,434 and decide at which (I)CSD a transaction is settled.
   (604)   In any event, even if customers were to monitor where transactions should be settled,
           the CCP would still have the ability to decide where their settlement leg should take
           place, as explained above.
   (605)   [BUSINESS SECRETS]"435
   (606)   The Notifying Parties submitted in their response to the Decision opening of the
           proceedings that the merged entity could not foreclose Euroclear as regards those
           securities for which Euroclear is the issuing CSD (i.e. primary settlement). The
           Commission however does not consider this argument relevant in relation to fixed
           income in particular, since, as explained above, there is demonstrably competition
           between Euroclear's and Clearstream's services. In addition, Euroclear and
           Clearstream compete in relation to the same type of underlyings (for example both
           settle transactions cleared by LCH Ltd related to German fixed income, Austrian
           fixed income, Irish fixed income, etc.), which means that the usual (national) issuing
           location of fixed income securities of a given nationality is not relevant.
   (607)   The Notifying Parties also consider in their response to the Statement of Objections
           that even if cleared repo transaction feeds were an important input, the merged entity
           would not have the ability to foreclose access to these inputs. They reiterate that
           CCPs do not dictate the settlement location. In particular (i) LCH.Clearnet's clearing
           members would still be able to settle cleared non-triparty repo trades with Euroclear
           Bank and (ii) the Notifying Parties’ CCPs have no plans (nor incentives) to close
           their settlement leg at Euroclear Bank. However, as explained above, the fact that
           members can in theory choose their settlement location has no bearing on the fact

         that CCPs choose its own settlement location and induce additional costs for
         customers. The Notifying Parties indicate themselves in the response to the
         Statement of Objections that settlement takes place on a default basis with a view to
         minimise cross-system settlement, unless customers express a preference. In any
         event, the Commission considers that cross-system settlement minimisation depends
         on the location chosen by the CCP for its settlement leg. By being the central point
         for transactions involving large banks, because settling at the same place as other
         trading counterparties is more efficient (network effects) and because customers tend
         to aggregate their assets with one settlement and custody service provider (as will be
         analysed in more detail in Section 8.4.4.2.2.1 below), the ability to influence the
         settlement location of cleared repo transactions has a much more significant impact
         than the mere share such transactions appear to represent within the total number of
         fixed income transactions. CCPs in practice can thus significantly influence if not
         decide where settlement should occur.
   (608) The Commission therefore considers that the merged entity would have the ability to
         divert cleared fixed income settlement feeds to Clearstream, which in turn would
         lead to increased costs and degraded service for competitors.
   (609) The Notifying Parties submit in addition that, even if the Notifying Parties’ CCPs
         chose Clearstream Banking for their settlement leg, customers would not have an
         incentive to switch to Clearstream Banking, because switching of settlement
         locations is inconsistent with current market behaviour. According to the Notifying
         Parties, post-Transaction, LCH.Clearnet’s customers would thus have no incentive to
         switch their cleared non-triparty repos settlement location, and the merged entity will
         be constrained by strong customers.
   (610) The Notifying Parties explain in particular that [BUSINESS SECRETS] of the trades
         of Clearstream customers cleared at LCH.Clearnet give rise to cross-system
         settlements, which has not prompted customers to switch to Euroclear Bank.
         According to the Notifying Parties' estimations provided in the response to the
         Statement of Objections, should LCH.Clearnet decide to settle in Clearstream,
         Euroclear's customers would have a probability of [BUSINESS SECRETS] instead
         of [BUSINESS SECRETS] pre-merger to incur external settlement on all their trades
         (including cleared and uncleared).
   (611) The Commission considers that the proportion of cross-system settlements occurring
         in relation to trades of Clearstream customers cleared at LCH.Clearnet should not
         necessarily be considered as a reference point, as certain fixed income transactions
         cannot be executed elsewhere than on DBAG (for example German bonds currently
         traded by the German Finance Agency are only traded on DBAG) and certain
         customers might choose Clearstream for specific reasons (such as local German
         customers) for example, inducing cross-system settlements that customers cannot
         avoid.
   (612) In addition, should LCH.Clearnet decide to divert transaction feeds to Euroclear,
         100% of the cleared trades currently settled at Euroclear would be impacted (which
         are not comparable with the [BUSINESS SECRETS] of trades cleared at
         LCH.Clearnet currently incurred by Clearstream customers). The fact that currently
         customers do not switch to Euroclear Bank, even though they could avoid external

             settlement by switching at least their non-triparty repos to Euroclear Bank, and that
             Euroclear's customers might incur [BUSINESS SECRETS] of cross-system
             settlement on average for all their trades,436 does not undermine the fact that the
             merged entity will have the ability to induce additional costs for its competitors. As
             will be explained in Section 8.4.4.2.2.1. below, it is actually likely that a non-
             negligible part of the customers would switch part or their whole fixed income
             portfolio to Clearstream, likely inducing others to switch as well.
   (613)     The Notifying Parties also claim that the Commission did not consider the specific
             value that Euroclear can offer to customers, for example through its CSD CREST for
             UK gilts. However, the Notifying Parties picked a specific example, for which there
             is at the moment relatively limited competition between Euroclear and Clearstream,
             while there are numerous other fixed income products (in particular euro-
             denominated ones such as German, Austrian, Portuguese, Spanish, Finnish, Dutch
             fixed income) for which they more closely compete.
   (614)     None of the above bring new or compelling arguments that would allow the
             Commission to dismiss its concerns regarding the ability of the merged entity to
             foreclose access to important inputs for international settlement and custody services
             related to fixed income.
   8.4.4.2.2. The merged entity would have the incentive to foreclose access to important inputs
             for settlement and custody services for EEA fixed income provided by ICSDs and
             global custodians
   8.4.4.2.2.1. The merged entity would have the incentive to divert cleared fixed income
             transaction feeds, which would degrade the service quality and cost level of
             competitors
   (615)     The diversion of clearing feeds to Clearstream would lead to increased operational
             costs for current Euroclear customers that clear with the Notifying Parties' CCPs, as
             cross-system settlement, as described above, is more costly and less efficient than
             internal settlement within the same (I)CSD/custodian.437 While the exact amount of
             cost and inefficiencies that can be created by LCH.Clearnet's feeds diversion is
             impossible to fully quantify as it depends on the portfolio and trading strategies and
             usual counterparties of each customer, there is clear evidence of the fact that
             additional costs would arise as a result of such action: the additional cost due to
             internal settlement vs external settlement was clearly identified by customers in the
             market estimation and the cost differential was estimated by Euroclear on the ICSD
   436
           The methodology used by the Notifying Parties is contestable. First, it assumes for uncleared
           transactions that the probability of making a cross-system settlement for Euroclear customers is equal to
           the proportion of all uncleared trades currently settled at Clearstream Luxembourg, while this
           probability depends on the volumes currently settled at Clearstream and Euroclear and the ability to find
           or choose counterparties which have the same service provider to allow a more efficient settlement.
           Second, the fact that half of the settlements of cleared trades would no longer take place at Euroclear
           Bank, while the other half would relate to Euroclear customers' leg and thus would remain with
           Euroclear, misrepresents the post-Transaction situation, as all cleared trades would lead to cross-system
           settlements for Euroclear customers. These calculations are in addition a static view which do not take
           into account potential switches of customers to Clearstream.

          side at € 0.50 (internal settlement) vs € 1.50 (external settlement) per transaction
          which can impact millions of repo cleared transactions.438 Cross-system settlement in
          addition leads to a higher rate of failed transactions (i.e. securities are not delivered
          on time and thus the transaction fails). This issue was also identified by customers
          and estimated by Euroclear at 94% (external settlement) instead of 99% (internal
          settlement).439
   (616)  As a consequence, in order to avoid cross-system settlement, a number of customers
          will likely switch to Euroclear's direct competitor, Clearstream. For example, in
          response to the question as to how they would react if LCH.Clearnet would require
          settlement into Clearstream, one customer indicates that it would "match
          LCH.Clearnet preference and look for another custodian"440; another explains that
          "[X] would not appreciate it but [X] would have to accept it"441. This means that a
          number of customers would switch to Clearstream as a consequence.
   (617)  All the customers that would remain with Euroclear would however be subject to
          cross-system settlement, should LCH.Clearnet divert its transaction leg to
          Clearstream. Therefore, irrespective of the number of securities and the number of
          customers moving to Clearstream, any customer not moving to Clearstream would
          face degraded conditions and would be worse off. Euroclear's ability to compete
          would thus be reduced.
   (618)  This effect is all the more likely for settlement intensive business. As explained in
          detail in Sections 7.2.2 and 8.4.4.2.1.1 above, essentially cleared repo transactions
          are based on HQLA (i.e. primarily highly rated and highly liquid government bonds
          and Eurobonds) and have a very short duration. Moreover, it is precisely the types of
          clients that the Notifying Parties compete for – large, international banks and dealers
          – that trade the most repos and use CCP clearing. Ownership for the bonds
          underlying these repos thus changes very frequently, and accordingly, the higher cost
          and implementation risk pertaining to external settlement could be a particularly
          important driver for a customer's choice to relocate its portfolio.442
   (619)  Moreover, and more generally, settlement is characterised by strong network effects
          and economies of scale, as recognised by the Notifying Parties in their response to
          the Decision opening the proceedings.443 These network effects stem from the fact
          that it is more efficient to trade with customers having the same settlement service
          provider in order to maximise the number of internal settlements. While pre-
          Transaction, customers within Clearstream could have access to internal settlement
          by trading among themselves and customers within Euroclear could also benefit from
          efficient settlement, customers of Euroclear would not be able to have such efficient
          settlement.
   438
         While these fees may not necessarily fully reflect the cost difference between cross-system settlement
         and internal settlement for Euroclear, the market investigation clearly identified differences in terms of
         operational efficiency and thus costs for customers between cross-system and internal settlement.

   (620)   The Commission acknowledges that Euroclear has a larger fixed income pool than
           Clearstream currently which might limit the movement of certain customers to
           Clearstream. However, the fact that certain customers indicated in the market
           investigation that they would be willing to move in case the CCP prefers to change
           settlement location shows that network effects are not necessarily the only factor
           customers consider in deciding which settlement location to choose.
   (621)   The fact that customers also tend to consolidate as much as possible their assets in a
           limited number of (I)CSDs and custodians might also be a factor that incentive the
           merged entity to enter into a foreclosure strategy.444 This tendency allows customers
           to easily and efficiently mobilise their assets for a given activity in the different
           transactions they are involved in. Should customers move certain assets used for
           cleared transactions to Clearstream, they are likely to move a much larger volume in
           order to efficiently settle their transactions and optimise the usability of their
           securities.
   (622)   The fact that customers would tend to move all or most of their assets when deciding
           to move a portion is also evidenced by internal documents of the Notifying Parties.
           [BUSINESS SECRETS]445 In that context, the Commission notes, as indicated
           above, that the Notifying Parties argument put forward in the response to the
           Decision opening the proceedings, namely that most large clients are multi-homing,
           is contradicted by both a subsequent response of the Notifying Parties to a request for
           information446 as well as the results of the market investigation.447 Customers to the
           contrary tend to consolidate their assets, at least by business line or by type of
           underlyings, in one place.448 One large international bank for example explained that
           "our CSD also hold securities we use for other purposes than CCP Repo. The benefit
           of having all at the same CSD is settlement and operational efficiency".449
   (623)   Therefore, even an initial diversion of only a moderate number of trades, may lead
           other trades and securities to follow, as a custodian explains for example in relation
           to Eurex Repo GC Pooling that "if one of our clients wants to participate in that
           market then part (if not all) of the securities we hold on its behalf would have to be
           transferred to Clearstream Banking"450.

         In the response of 15 November 2016 to a request for information dated 9 November 2016, the
         Notifying Parties explain that "Due to the fact that consolidation of activity and assets in one location
         offers clear efficiency benefits for market participants (e.g. operational risk, settlement netting,
         collateral optimisation etc.) market participants will typically try to maintain a single collateral
         account for the same activity. [BUSINESS SECRETS]". In response to the Decision opening the
         proceedings of 28 September 2016, the Notifying Parties submitted that "the analysis ignores an
         important aspect of customer behaviour. Currently, market participants are multi-homing […]
         Clearstream expects that all large customers […] usually have an account at both Clearstream and

   (624)    Irrespective of the exact number of customers which will move and the exact number
            of assets such customers would initially move, the merged entity will be able to
            increase settlement costs for Euroclear's customers staying at Euroclear. This will put
            an upward pressure on prices that Clearstream can follow. In addition, due to
            network effects between customers and of economies of scale and scope for each
            individual customer, an initial movement of some assets by some customers will
            increase the likelihood of these customers moving a large share of their assets to
            Clearstream and other customers to move to Clearstream.
   (625)    The Notifying Parties submit in their response to the Statement of Objections that
            Euroclear's customers will have an incentive to stay with Euroclear, as Euroclear's
            ability to offer settlement and custody for cleared repo trades and the quality of its
            offer cannot deteriorate as a result of any foreclosure, even if cross-system costs
            increase. The market would not "tip" to Clearstream even if only a partial foreclosure
            strategy were applied, due to network effects and economies of consolidation.
   (626)    However, although Euroclear might continue to benefit from network and
            consolidation effects for non-triparty repos and bonds (Clearstream being the market
            leader for triparty repos), the Notifying Parties do not take into account the benefits
            that customers would have consolidating all their fixed income business including
            triparty repos at Clearstream (which enjoys a larger size than Euroclear in this area).
            Also, the fact that various initiatives are launched to compete even in case network
            effects exist (cf. competition between €GC Plus and GC Pooling, new ventures
            launched by several market participants in the interest rate derivatives, etc.) shows
            that market participants consider that network effects can be overcome. In any event,
            the assessment of the potential foreclosure of Euroclear should not be based on
            whether the market would in all likelihood fully tip on the basis of an increased
            cross-system settlement, but whether the merged entity would have the ability and
            incentive to increase the costs of using competitors and / or degrade their service, and
            as a consequence impede their ability to compete such as to have a significant effect
            on competition.
   (627)    The merged entity would thus have the incentive to divert cleared fixed income
            transaction feeds, as it would increase the cost level of competitors, degrade their
            service quality and prevent them from serving the whole portfolio of customers
            which is often required by customers.
   8.4.4.2.2.2. The merged entity would have the incentive to divert cleared fixed income
            transaction feeds to Clearstream, as it would increase its revenues
   (628)    The merger will lead to de facto monopolies in the markets for clearing of repos and
            bonds. Customers requiring clearing services would have no choice but to clear at
            Eurex or LCH. The merged entity would thus not risk losing profit on the upstream
            market.
   (629)    Internal documents of DBAG also indicate that it would have the incentive to divert
            settlement flows from Euroclear to Clearstream, for example by making Clearstream
            the default location of its CCPs. Already pre-Transaction, DBAG was indeed
            considering diverting UK securities through CBL and all euro denominated securities
            through T2S by adding a settlement and safekeeping venue to the LSE-LCH.Clearnet
            domestic trading chain: "The default settlement location for LCH.Clearnet is
            Euroclear UK for domestic and Euroclear Bank for international securities. LSE and
            LCH.Clearnet would make Clearstream a settlement location and change the default
            international flow from Euroclear Bank to Clearstream. The main external

           dependencies would be to convince issuers and investors to use the new service, as
           the choice is with them to remain in Euroclear UK or Euroclear Bank, or move to a
           new offering." While DBAG indicates that "In the past [they] were not able to
           convince LSE and LCH.Clearnet to make CBL a settlement location",451 the
           incentives of these entities by being part of the same group as Clearstream and all the
           vertically integrated subsidiaries would change after the Transaction. Indeed, by
           introducing Clearstream as a settlement location for LCH.Clearnet's transaction flow
           pre-Transaction, LSE and LCH.Clearnet would have risked losing market shares to
           DBAG's competing venues at trading and clearing level.
   (630)   Post-Transaction however, there is no risk for the merged entity to lose business at
           clearing level, and only the perspective to gain business from Euroclear in the
           downstream market, as the merged entity's CCPs will face no alternative in relation
           to CCP clearing of fixed income (triparty repos, non-triparty repos, bonds). In this
           regard, one customer fears that "the actual availability of alternative service
           providers in clearing and settlement services, availability driven by critical mass and
           favorable business cases, could result [in] allowing major player to direct the flow
           through their own entities."452
   (631)   The Notifying Parties cite in their response to the Statement of Objections the
           following document's extract "[BUSINESS SECRETS]" to support the fact that
           Clearstream was only considered as one alternative and that customers would still be
           able to choose. However, the Commission considers that pre-merger LCH.Clearnet
           had the incentive to leave choice to customers which might not be the case post-
           Transaction, once LCH.Clearnet and Clearstream are part of the same group. Second,
           the choice is always on one side of the transaction: the CCP can always decide to
           favour a settlement and custody service provider, which has de facto an impact on
           the costs and quality of service received by the trading counterparty.
   (632)   The fact that DBAG currently has an account at Euroclear for certain of its activities
           is not indicative of a potential lack of incentive to close it or to favour Clearstream
           after the Transaction. The exceptions to the vertical silo structure of DBAG pertain
           to products where DBAG's market share is currently relatively small, such as for
           example the ATS trading and clearing of non-triparty repos. Euroclear considers that
           "This willingness to settle in EB is however ‘opportunistic’: ECAG wishes to compete
           against LSE's CCPs for this type of business [special fixed income repo], for
           customers who prefer to hold their assets in EB."453 Eurex has indeed small clearing
           volumes in this market currently and is competing with LCH.Clearnet, the market
           leader and only alternative. Where DBAG's market share is large, for example in
           ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos, settlement in Clearstream is mandatory.
           Euroclear considers that the interest in having an account in Euroclear post-
           Transaction and depart from DBAG's vertical silo structure may thus disappear:
           "Post-merger however, competition between ECAG and LSE’s CCPs for this repo
           business will be eliminated and allowing settlement in EB will no longer be in the
           interests of the merged entity – as a monopoly in the clearing of repos, the merged
           entity can dictate where settlement takes place. This illustrates that access to

            settlement streams is provided for strategic reasons […]. That is, the repo CCPs are
            currently in competition with each other and for this reason have no incentives to
            disallow settlement where their clients find it most beneficial to themselves. But this
            incentive will no longer apply if CCPs face no competition."454
   (633)    According to the Notifying Parties in their response to the Statement of Objections,
            the merged entity would equally have no incentive to foreclose access to such inputs.
            The merged entity would be deterred by the risk of loss of revenues upstream as a
            result of customers switching to uncleared trades. Most customers would not switch
            to Clearstream for their settlements, and so, contrary to the scenario hypothesised in
            the Statement of Objections, there would be no prospect of significant gains in
            custody and CMS resulting from engaging in a foreclosure strategy.
   (634)    As explained in detail in Section 7.2.2 (repos) and 6.2 (bonds), the Commission
            considers to the contrary that customers would not switch to uncleared trades for
            ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos, ATS traded and CCP cleared
            triparty repos, and cleared bonds. In addition, as explained in Section 8.4.4.2.1.1,
            cleared repo transactions are particularly important inputs, because of the specific
            types of repo transactions that are cleared (inter-dealer transactions, short term
            repos), the particular role and size of the CCP, and the fact that a diversion of cleared
            transactions can have a direct impact on the settlement location of uncleared
            transactions.
   (635)    [BUSINESS SECRETS] The Notifying Parties might not necessarily have to enter
            into unlawful strategies in engaging in such foreclosure strategies, as suggested by
            the Notifying Parties.
   (636)    The Commission therefore considers that the merged entity would have the incentive
            to divert cleared fixed income transaction feeds to Clearstream, as its de facto
            monopoly positions on the upstream markets would allow it to increase its revenues
            on the downstream market without facing revenues upstream.
   (637)    All the above leads to high incentives for DBAG to engage into a foreclosure
            strategy, as it can only gain part or all of the assets of customers, while competitors'
            settlement costs – and as a consequence custody costs (as well as collateral
            management costs as will be explained in Section 8.4.4.3 below) –, as soon as
            customers move part or all of their assets to Clearstream – will in any event appear
            higher than pre-merger and competitors' ability to compete will be reduced.
   8.4.4.2.3. The merger would impede effective competition in the market for international
            settlement and custody for fixed income provided by ICSDs and global custodians
   (638)    The Commission guidelines on the assessment of non-horizontal mergers indicate
            that "significant harm to effective competition normally requires that the foreclosed
            firms play a sufficiently important role in the competitive process on the downstream
            market"455. They also indicate that "for input foreclosure to lead to consumer harm,
            it is not necessary that the merged firm's rivals are forced to exit the market".456
            Input foreclosure thus leads to competition concerns in case the merger reduces the

           ability of rivals to compete in the downstream market and raises barriers to entry to
           potential competitors.457
   (639)   First, by increasing the number of cross-system settlements for customers of
           Euroclear, Clearstream will de facto increase costs and degrade the quality of service
           for Euroclear's customers. Should customers decide to move part of their assets to
           Clearstream (for example those used for cleared fixed income transactions), the lack
           of access to the merged entity's transaction feeds will prevent competitors to provide
           single-homing for the fixed income's portfolio of customers.458 As will be explained
           below, fixed income used in repo transactions can also be used as collateral in other
           transactions which is an additional incentive for customers to move all their portfolio
           and be able to mobilise optimally their fixed income assets. Customers would thus
           unlikely move just part of their assets. Second, Euroclear has an important role in the
           competitive process, by being a very close competitor to Clearstream. The two
           ICSDs are the only ICSDs in the EEA. They target the same type of customers, i.e.
           large international customers which want to have a one-stop-shop service provider
           for all their European activities in a given business line (for example fixed income),
           e.g. "[BUSINESS SECRETS]")459. Smaller customers on the contrary use national
           CSDs for their domestic market and custodians for their international activities (if
           any), as custodians provide additional, more tailor-made services that are not
           necessarily required by large institutions.460
   (640)   Both offer similar services, as highlighted by several customers in the market
           investigation ("Broadly speaking, Euroclear and Clearstream offer the same range
           of ICSD services and collateral management services."461; "Euroclear and
           Clearstream provide similar services"462). Both Euroclear and Clearstream are
           particularly well positioning in serving certain types of assets (fixed income in
           particular). They are subject to the same regulatory environment in comparison to
           custodians which allows them to provide more services (for example hold collateral
           of CCPs).
   457
         Non-horizontal Merger Guidelines, paragraphs 47-49.
   458
         The Notifying Parties in their response to the Statement of Objections claim that the fact that customers
         tend to single-home shows that cleared and uncleared transaction feeds should be part of the same
         market, likewise for trades of different asset classes. The Commission considers however that single-
         homing shows that customers derive benefits from consolidating their trades with one or a limited
         number of service providers, generally for a given type of securities. This is thus not in itself a
         sufficient indication for considering a single market for settlement and custody services overall. In
         addition, cleared fixed income transaction feeds are considered important inputs for settlement and
         custody for fixed income, which is a different question from defining the upstream market. The
         Commission in any event considered a market for international settlement and custody services for
         fixed income, without distinguishing settlement of cleared transactions vs settlement of uncleared
         transactions.

   (641)   Internal documents of DBAG also show that Euroclear is its main competitor;
           [BUSINESS SECRETS]"463
   (642)   The two companies in addition compete fiercely on price, and on non-price elements
           such as innovative services and products.464 Euroclear and Clearstream have for
           example launched directly competing innovations (for example cleared triparty
           repos: GCPooling for DBAG and €GC Plus for Euroclear together with LCH).
   (643)   The competitive pressure exercised by Clearstream and Euroclear pre-merger will
           not be replaced by global custodians. While JP Morgan and BNY Mellon, the two
           largest global custodians, also offer custody services for large customers in many
           countries, they are not significantly active in fixed income. As submitted by the
           Notifying Parties, ICSDs compete in particular for the HQLA portfolios, comprising
           mostly government bonds, of large clients, whereas custodians have their stronghold
           in equities.465 One market participant explained that "[…] sovereign debt [is] pooled
           in the ICSDs in order to create maximum economies of scale in terms of assets
           available for collateralisation, repo and/or securities lending."466
   (644)   In addition, there would be high barriers to expansion for global custodians. One
           customer explains for example the advantage for customers to hold fixed income in
           an ICSD: "[there is] a significant concentration of bonds, mainly Govies, on
           Clearstream Banking Luxembourg’s platform. The decision to hold the Govies with
           Clearstream is driv[en] by the presence of large number of counterparties on the
           same settlement system hence leveraging the possibility of efficient and low cost
           settlement processing while mitigating operational risk."467 Should a customer move
           to a custodian, it would not benefit from the fact that a large number of customers
           use the same service providers as they can benefit either with Clearstream or with
           Euroclear today, including for uncleared transactions.
   (645)   In addition, JP Morgan and BNY Mellon would not be in a position to have better
           access to cleared repo transaction feeds, as the merged entity will also have the same
           ability and incentive to restrict their access to transaction feeds. [BUSINESS
           SECRETS]468 While ICSDs directly receive transaction feeds and collateral deposits
           from CCPs, custodians primarily receive feeds from bilateral transactions, which
           allow Euroclear and Clearstream to be better placed to offer custody services to
           customers for fixed income securities used in relation to cleared transactions, and are
           in practice able to provide services for the whole fixed income portfolio of
           customers.
   (646)   Custodians also appear to be less involved in settlement, and thus to depend on
           (I)CSDs: "[C]ompared with (I)CSDs, custodians perform much less internal
           settlement (i.e. between their own accounts). This is because the case where a global

          custodian has two parties to a trade on their system is less frequent, and some
          custodians have decided, even when it happens, to still 'externalize' the settlement
          with an investor or issuer CSD"469.
   (647)  The fact that Euroclear group (as a whole) is larger than Clearstream group (as a
          whole) is not indicative of the competitive pressure they currently exercise on each
          other and which would be lost through the merger. When arguing in the response to
          the Decision opening the proceedings that Euroclear is currently much larger than
          Clearstream, the Notifying Parties do not distinguish between the different activities
          of both groups (CSD/ICSD, different categories of assets, etc.). While single-homing
          might occur across asset classes, benefits of single-homing (such as settlement
          netting) requires the aggregation of securities of a given asset class, such as fixed
          income securities. As analysed in Sections 6 (bonds), 7 (repos) and 8.3.2.1.6, a
          distinction should thus be drawn between activities in fixed income and equities at
          trading, clearing and post-trade levels. In addition, a distinction should be drawn
          between activities which entail home-bias (i.e. services - primarily through CSDs -
          provided to local customers which only trade securities of a given nationality) and
          activities targeting international customers (such as ICSD services and potentially the
          direct links such customers have to CSD services), as analysed in Section 8.3.2.1.4.
          As Euroclear group owns several national CSDs (CSDs of France, Belgium and
          Netherlands on a single platform, Euroclear Finland, Euroclear Sweden and
          Euroclear UK & Ireland (EUI)), considering all the revenues of these CSDs blurs the
          relative strength of Euroclear vs Clearstream in relation to services for international
          customers. The overall size of both groups is thus not the relevant benchmark.
   (648)  The document "[BUSINESS SECRETS]"470, [BUSINESS SECRETS]. Another
          document indicates that "[BUSINESS SECRETS]".471
   (649)  In their response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties distinguish
          between CSD's and ICSD's activities, and estimate that the current difference in size
          between Clearstream Banking and Euroclear Bank remains significant, with
          Euroclear having more than 2/3 of the activities shared by both ICSDs. In any event,
          the fact that Euroclear might benefit from network effects arising from its larger size
          pre-Transaction does not undermine the fact that the merged entity would have the
          ability and incentive to reduce competitors' ability to compete, even if it might be
          insufficient to fully exclude them from the market, as explained at the beginning of
          this section. All of them will be disadvantaged, by being foreclosed from cleared
          repo transaction feeds (fully or partially).
   (650)  In addition, the Notifying Parties consider that the Statement of Objections fails to
          acknowledge that (i) currently, most of the repo trades are settled by Euroclear Bank,
          the majority of which are uncleared; (ii) in the context of strong network effects
          whereby customers aim to maximise internal settlements, Euroclear Bank has a
          significant competitive advantage relative to Clearstream Banking; and (iii) as a
          result, diverting LCH.Clearnet’s repo feeds to Clearstream Banking – if at all
          feasible – is unlikely to have any material impact on the offer of Euroclear Bank
          relative to Clearstream Banking. Euroclear Bank would continue to have a

           significant advantage in terms of network effects, having a share estimated by the
           Notifying Parties at [70-80%] even in an artificially narrow EEA-wide market for
           settlement of bonds and repos by ICSDs.472 According to the Notifying Parties in
           their response to the Statement of Objections, a diversion of LCH.Clearnet's repo
           feeds would not in any case impede competition between Clearstream and Euroclear.
           There would be no cost increase at Euroclear if cleared repos were fully diverted to
           Clearstream, because cleared repos amount only to a relatively small share of
           Euroclear's total business. According to the Notifying Parties, their analysis of
           market share data and the relative importance of LCH.Clearnet’s trade feeds and
           uncleared feeds for Euroclear's business show that a diversion of LCH.Clearnet’s
           trade feeds would not result in average Euroclear customers clearing (non-triparty or
           triparty) repo trades with LCH.Clearnet to switch to Clearstream.
   (651)   As explained above, the Commission however considers that cleared repo trades are
           of particular importance for international settlement and custody services for fixed
           income by being often used for short-term dealer-to-dealer transactions. The mere
           volumes of cleared repo transactions settled at Euroclear thus do not properly
           represent their importance. In addition, in its quality of CCP, LCH.Clearnet cannot
           be considered as one of many other counterparties in repo trades, but has a central
           role in the repo market, being the focal point in case of cleared transactions, and in
           particular for transactions involving large counterparties which are significant users
           of CCP services. Finally, the fact that Euroclear Bank currently has larger market
           shares than Clearstream Banking and benefits from network effects will not prevent
           negative effects on competition post-Transaction.
   (652)   The Notifying Parties also consider that Euroclear would be able to mitigate any
           effect of the alleged foreclosure strategy: Euroclear could in particular decrease the
           external settlement fee they charge to customers in order to compensate the increased
           settlement cost and inefficiencies customers would face as a consequence of the
           additional external settlement that might arise from a potential foreclosure attempt.
           However, by focusing on the fees, the Notifying Parties do not take into account all
           the costs arising from external settlement, including for example settlement delay or
           failed settlement (the existence of which is confirmed by the Notifying Parties).
           [BUSINESS SECRETS], while Euroclear indicated that this project was part of
           broader negotiations, including access for Euroclear entities to Eurex trades, that are
           captive within DBAG.473 The full context of the overall ongoing negotiations
           between both groups might thus be considered. In any event, the existence of
           inefficiencies arising from cross-system settlement was clearly identified in the
           market investigation, including in ECB studies, and the ability of the merged entity's
           CCPs to degrade the access to settlement feeds to competitors was also supported by
           the Commission's market investigation (see Section 8.4.4.2.1).
   (653)   The Commission considers that there would be no market player able to replace the
           competitive pressure exercised by Euroclear on Clearstream.
   472
         This figure does not only take into account euro denominated fixed income securities for which there
         are balance sheet netting that incentivises customers to aggregate euro denominated fixed income
         securities together, but also other currencies. As Euroclear is particularly present in GBP, Euroclear's
         market share estimated by the Notifying Parties can be considered as the upper relevant bound.

   (654)  The Notifying Parties argue that market participants would have the choice between
          a value chain with Euroclear at the bottom (via EuroCCP and SIX which are
          interoperable with LCH.Clearnet) and a value chain with Clearstream at the bottom
          (by assumption via LSE, LCH.Clearnet). This is however not the case for repos and
          more generally fixed income transactions where there is no CCP alternative to those
          of the Notifying Parties. Customers would thus have no choice but using the merged
          entity's CCPs and thus be dependent on the CCPs' decisions in relation to settlement
          and custody services.
   (655)  The merger would also raise barriers to entry to potential competitors. The
          Commission's Non-horizontal Merger Guidelines indicate that "Effective competition
          on the downstream market may be significantly impeded by raising barriers to entry,
          in particular if input foreclosure would entail for such potential competitors the need
          to enter at both the downstream and the upstream level in order to compete
          effectively on either market".474
   (656)  Should a new player want to directly compete in the market for international
          settlement and custody services for fixed income by creating a new ICSD, it would
          face high barriers to entry. Entry in the ICSD space is already very difficult, as
          demonstrated by several failed entry attempts in the last few years. BNY Mellon
          tried to launch its own (I)CSD, but closed it. DBAG commented in internal
          documents on BNY Mellon's attempt to enter the market: "[BUSINESS
          SECRETS]"475
   (657)  LSEG itself has been trying to launch its own (I)CSD, globeSettle, [BUSINESS
          SECRETS]. As indicated in the Notifying Parties' internal documents, JP Morgan
          and LSEG (though Monte Titoli) were supposed to launch a "new Luxembourg CSD
          which would build on the infrastructure and expertise of [Monte Titoli] and connect
          to T2S through Italian CSD".476 In relation to globeSettle's launch, DBAG's
          documents indicate: "This brings me to the second challenger, the LSE. In the last
          year, the LSE has also established a new CSD in Luxembourg, GlobeSettle.
          [BUSINESS SECRETS]477 [BUSINESS SECRETS]478
   (658)  DBAG also mentions the attempt of the Swiss SIX: [DBAG'S INTERNAL
          ASSESSMENT OF SIX'S ACTIVITIES]."479 As evidenced by this quote, DBAG
          does not expect T2S to be sufficient to remove the high barriers to entry in
          international custody services for fixed income and compete with Clearstream's and
          Euroclear's ICSDs.
   (659)  Post-Transaction there would be no other credible competitor active in the
          downstream markets, who, as the merged entity, is also vertically integrated, since
          Euroclear, as well as BNY Mellon and JP Morgan are not active in settlement of
          cleared transactions irrespective of the assets or transactions concerned. Such a
          situation is likely to raise further already elevated barriers to entry on the market for

          settlement for fixed income transactions and as a consequence on the market for
          custody of fixed income and in turn the market for collateral management.
   (660)  A number of market participants underline the risks of foreclosure arising from the
          merger and the impact on competition ultimately.480 The concerns raised corroborate
          the conclusions of the Commission: they come from the increased concentration at
          clearing level which will impact the ability of downstream competitors to compete.
          One customer considers for example that "As the ‘new company’ would have a very
          strong market share not only as CCP but also regarding settlement […] [it] hopes
          that they will be forced to run at least three different companies (ATS, CCP and
          CSD) which should all have an open architecture by granting access also to other
          service providers."481 This would be even more the case in view of the increased
          importance of clearing.
   (661)  The foreclosure strategy that the merged entity would have the ability and incentive
          to put in place would furthermore run counter to the objectives of CSDR and of T2S
          which aim at promoting competition at settlement level. The Commission's
          guidelines indicate in this regard that "[t]he concern of raising entry barriers is
          particularly relevant in those industries that are opening up to competition or are
          expected to do so in the foreseeable future."482 It specifies that "[i]t is important that
          regulatory measures aimed at opening a market are not rendered ineffective through
          vertically-related incumbent companies merging and thereby closing off the market,
          or eliminating each other as potential entrants."483
   (662)  By impeding competition in the settlement and custody market before T2S is fully
          operational, the Transaction might also jeopardise the objective of T2S which is to
          reduce the costs of cross-border settlement (i.e. settlement of securities issued in a
          given country into CSDs of another country) and thus also favour competition at
          settlement level. DBAG indeed has the intention to [BUSINESS SECRETS] provide
          customers with a single pool of securities which would not face any cross-system
          settlement anymore. Only Euroclear would have this ability as well. [EVIDENCE
          BASED ON INTERNAL DOCUMENTS, CONTAINING BUSINESS
          SECRETS]"484 This shows how close competitors Euroclear and Clearstream are,
          and how they are expected to compete post-T2S full implementation. [BUSINESS
          SECRETS] Euroclear (which owns several national CSDs and an ICSD),
          [BUSINESS SECRETS] might have already enjoyed certain scale and network
          advantages. Despite this, the two ICSDs can today compete for the whole set of fixed
          income (cleared and uncleared, different nationalities) when they have access to
          CCPs' transaction feeds. However, the market is unlikely to remain as competitive
          post-Transaction.
   (663)  T2S may thus lead Clearstream and Euroclear to compete even more directly,
          provided that Euroclear does not face additional costs induced by the dominant
          position of the merged entity at clearing level before T2S effects can arise. As new
          entrants are relatively unlikely in the ICSD in the short term, competition between

             the two ICSDs is expected to be strengthened. Internal documents of the Notifying
             Parties also show that Clearstream and Euroclear are best placed to compete post-
             T2S implementation, both through their ICSDs and CSDs.485 The picture below
             clearly shows that Euroclear is considered as its main competitor by Clearstream in
             the future T2S world.486 One customer explains that it expects "T2S [to] reinforce
             ICSDs that can now access to all domestic markets from one single entry point."487
   Figure 7: [SCREENSHOT FROM INTERNAL DOCUMENT DISCUSSING
   CLEARSTREM'S POSITIONING
   (664)     The Notifying Parties also submit that engaging in a foreclosure strategy would
             damage their reputation and result in retaliation from large customers in all its other
             activities. However, the foreclosure mechanism does not require the merged entity to
             oblige customers to move their securities to Clearstream. [BUSINESS SECRETS].
             By increasing the settlement costs for customers, the merged entity will however
             create a disincentive to stay with Euroclear. This may not be sufficiently high to
             make all customers move but will necessarily lead to an increase in settlement cost
             and service quality delivered by Euroclear (and any other competitor willing to enter
             the market and compete for the whole fixed income portfolio of customers, in
             particular the high quality assets re-used in various transactions) and lead to a partial
             foreclosure of these competitors, impeding their ability to compete.
   (665)     However, even large customers appear to be unable to impose their wills on
             significant infrastructure providers like DBAG. Customers (among others large
             broker-dealers such as Barclays, Société Générale, Bank of America Merrill Lynch)
             consistently underline in the market investigation the lack of open access and
             interoperability of Eurex (for example in the context of equities clearing) as one of
             DBAG's main weaknesses and complain about the high fees paid to DBAG
             compared to open / interoperable services providers.488 Morgan Stanley indicates for
             example that "[s]o far, [DBAG, the German infrastructure operator] has been most
             resistant to allowing interoperability in its infrastructure".489 Another large customer
             underlines the unwillingness of DBAG to follow customers' requirements: "DBAG
             are vertically siloed and have not until now been amenable to interoperability
             discussions. Their service offering is functional but not open to innovation or value
             added service."490 However, they have not been able to oblige DBAG to open its
             vertical silo. The ability of the Notifying Parties to resist to customers' demand is
             unlikely to diminish with the Transaction.
   (666)     In addition, the Notifying Parties argue that the Commission relies on a narrow
             selection of evidence, i.e. Euroclear's submissions and those of a select number of
             companies, primarily French companies, which are allegedly unsubstantiated.
   (667)     The Commission acknowledges that factual evidence on the functioning of the
             market provided in Euroclear's submissions has been used by the Commission in its
             assessment. The Commission tested in its market investigation the key elements

             Commission exercised in its final assessment its own judgement, as can be
             demonstrated by the fact that not all the claims submitted by Euroclear have been
             considered relevant by the Commission. Regarding the fact that French companies

             factually wrong and cannot be reconciled with the responses received. The Notifying
             Parties might refer to the response of the association Paris Europlace, but there are a
             number of other companies which consider that the effect of a foreclosure would be
             harmful for their business, for example TD Bank (Canada), Danske Bank (Denmark),
             Deutsche Bank AG (Germany), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (United Kingdom),
             Jefferies International Limited - (United Kingdom).492
   (668)     In this context, the Commission does not accept the argument of the Notifying
             Parties, that LCH.Clearnet is [BUSINESS SECRETS]. First, there are no indications
             that it could not simply use Clearstream for these purposes going forward. Second,
             [BUSINESS SECRETS], it would hardly seem conceivable that Euroclear would
             refuse selling its services simply because it has been foreclosed from other parts of
             the business.
   (669)     In view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the Transaction would lead
             to a significant impediment of effective competition by providing the merged entity
             with the ability and the incentive to foreclose its competitors from the market for
             international settlement and custody services for fixed income.
   8.4.4.2.4. Neither T2S nor the CSDR would prevent the harm that would result from the
             Transaction
   (670)     The new rule of open access of the CSD Regulation and the introduction of T2S are
             unlikely to prevent any foreclosure in the downstream market for international
             settlement and custody for fixed income (and the downstream market for collateral
             management, see below Section 8.4.4.3.3.).
   (671)     Article 53 of CSDR provides that "A CCP and a trading venue shall provide
             transaction feeds on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis to a CSD upon
             request by the CSD and may charge a reasonable commercial fee for such
             transaction feeds to the requesting CSD on a cost-plus basis, unless otherwise
             agreed by both parties." Recital (59) provides for certain conditions under which
             access can be denied and could be used by the merged entity to refuse access to
             transaction feeds: "Such access may be refused only where it threatens the smooth
             and orderly functioning of the financial markets or causes systemic risk and may not
             be denied on the grounds of loss of market share." The RTS on authorisation,
             supervisory and operational requirements for central securities depositories specifies
             further the conditions for refusal of access in Article 89.493

           The Commission adopted the RTS on authorisation, supervisory and operational requirements for
           central securities depositories on 11 November 2016 specifying the conditions to refuse access in
           Article 89 therein. See Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/392 of 11 November 2016
           supplementing Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council with
EN                                                       129                                                 EN

   (672)   While this RTS still awaited publication in the Official Journal while the
           Commission was conducting its market investigation, it would appear that even if the
           merged entity were not able to deny access, it would still have the ability to
           implement the foreclosure strategy outlined above. The CSDR does not oblige for
           example a CCP to have accounts in all (I)CSDs. The merged entity could decide to
           close its account with Euroclear; customers would still be able to have their accounts
           with Euroclear, but securities would have to cross between Clearstream's and
           Euroclear's systems. Thereby, it would simply increase cross-system settlement
           events. Even if the merged entity were not to close its accounts in Euroclear, the
           CSDR does not prevent a CCP to decide where transactions between itself and
           trading counterparties shall be settled. The merged entity would thus also have the
           ability to induce additional costs for Euroclear's customers through additional cross-
           system settlements. It should also be noted that while CSDR requires CCPs to
           provide transaction feeds to CSDs, it does not require CCPs to provide feeds to
           custodians. Finally, as regards collateral management (which will be analysed in
           Section 8.4.4.3), this service is not covered by open access requirements in existing
           regulation.
   (673)   As for TARGET2-Securities ("T2S"), this is a project launched in 2008 by the
           European Central Bank in order to remove barriers and eliminate differences
           between domestic and cross-border/cross-system settlement by offering a single
           market infrastructure solution for the Eurozone. The T2S Framework Agreement was
           signed by 24 CSDs, which will migrate to the T2S platform in five waves between
           June 2015 and September 2017.494
   (674)   However, ICSDs will not be part of T2S, therefore cross-system settlement will still
           continue to occur. As indicated above, ICSDs provide a different value proposition
           for customers than national CSDs: they offer, inter alia asset servicing for assets
           issued in several countries. Such services require knowledge of the national
           regulation (for example as regards tax), experience, size and brand recognition. It is
           thus highly unlikely that customers would switch to several national CSDs, simply
           because settlement between national CSDs is facilitated by T2S. The ability for the
           merged entity to divert transactions feeds to its own CSDs and ICSD is likely to
           remain intact after the full migration of CSDs on T2S.
   (675)   Furthermore, T2S only covers euro-denominated securities that are considered
           eligible by the ECB and will thus not address potential foreclosure for Eurobonds
           and securities in other currencies. By way of background, according to DBAG's
           internal documents, the total Eurobonds market size is significant, as it amounts to
           EUR 10 trillion in outstanding debt (EUR 6 trillion for euro denominated securities),
           out of which [50-60%] of euro denominated securities reside with Clearstream's
           ICSD.495 In addition, Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to continue to compete
           particularly closely after the full implementation of T2S, as they already have
           international capabilities to serve international clients and securities. While the
         regard to regulatory technical standards on authorisation, supervisory and operational requirements for
         central securities depositories (OJ L 65, 10.3.2017, p. 48–115).

         For the time being, Denmark is the only non-euro area country which will make its currency available
         for settlement on T2S (scheduled for 2018).

             Notifying Parties argue that Euroclear is much larger in settlement, custody and
             collateral management than Clearstream, in the space of securities covered by T2S,
             Clearstream is of comparable size, if not larger than Euroclear, with [40-50%] of the
             securities concerned according to its own internal documents.496
   (676)     In addition, the effective implementation of T2S may take more time than the simple
             migration of the CSDs to the platform which was planned to end by September 2017.
             The last migration waves may also encounter some operational delays, as faced by
             Euroclear and Monte Titoli.497 In addition, according to Euroclear, the risks, and
             therefore costs, associated with cross-CSD settlement are also likely to remain in the
             short term, pending the full implementation of the T2S platform and until the
             insolvency procedures between countries in Europe are harmonised.
   (677)     In view of the foregoing, the Commission considers that neither T2S nor the CSDR
             would prevent the harm that would to result from the Transaction.
   8.4.4.2.5. Conclusion
   (678)     In view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the Transaction would lead
             to a significant impediment of effective competition in the markets for settlement and
             custody services provided in relation to fixed income by ICSDs and global
             custodians. This is because, in view of the Notifying Parties' de facto monopoly in
             the market for ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repo clearing, the market for
             ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repo clearing and to a lesser extent, the market
             for CCP clearing of bonds, the merged entity would have the ability and incentive to
             partially foreclose competitors, and more particularly its closest competitor
             Euroclear, by diverting cleared repo transaction feeds to Clearstream, which would
             prevent competitors from being able to effectively compete. Euroclear being
             Clearstream's closest competitor and only other ICSD, it has a specific role in the
             competitive process taking place in the relevant markets. The foreclosure of
             Euroclear in particular but also other competitors (which already today generally do
             not receive settlement feeds from CCPs and are less active than the two ICSDs in
             relation to fixed income) would thus have a significant impact on competition on the
             relevant markets.
   8.4.4.3. Assessment related to the market for collateral management
   8.4.4.3.1. The merged entity would have the ability to foreclose access to important inputs for
   collateral management
   8.4.4.3.1.1. Cleared repo transaction feeds are an important input for collateral management
   (679)     From a general point of view, CSDs, ICSDs and custodians provide collateral
             management on the basis of the duty given by customers to manage the assets they
             (electronically) hold in custody (and receive through transaction settlement). It is

           [BUSINESS SECRETS] However, the Notifying Parties indicated to be unable to provide market
           shares for settlement in T2S (response to RFI 21, question 39), for bond settlement overall (see for
           example RFI 10, question 26) and for global custody services (see for example RFI 21, question 38).
           The Notifying Parties indicated in response to RFI 10, question 26 that they have a combined market
           share of [30-40%] for primary settlement of bonds.

          also possible for customers to appoint a different service provider for custody
          services and for collateral management services. In such case, the CMS provider
          needs to have access to assets held in custody at a third party.498
   (680)  The assets used in ATS traded CCP cleared repo transactions are high quality liquid
          assets, i.e. assets that are highly demanded and have a high recognised value on the
          market (for example German government bonds). These assets are the ones generally
          accepted by all CCPs as collateral in all types of transactions and including in
          derivative transactions which are collateral intensive ("CCPs generally accept
          central government securities as collateral in repo operations, while some CCPs
          (such as Eurex and soon also LCH.Clearnet SA) also accept a broader set of eligible
          collateral and correspondingly wider array of haircuts also applies."499). Assets of
          lower quality can either not be accepted by CCPs (i.e. not eligible as collateral) or
          require to post additional margin to cover the additional risk taken by the CCP, and
          are thus more costly for customers.
   (681)  The ability for CMS providers to have access to cleared repo feeds is therefore
          important for the management of collateral (in relation to all types of transactions,
          including derivatives).
   (682)  The Notifying Parties submit that the Statement of Objections is based on an unduly
          narrow market definition which ignores the fact that CMS can be provided on the
          basis of feeds of either cleared or uncleared trades, as well as on the basis of feeds
          from repos and bonds but also equity transactions, and that in this context, the input
          from LCH.Clearnet to Euroclear Bank's services is modest.
   (683)  However, the Commission considers that the specific type of assets used in cleared
          repo transactions (government bonds that are HQLA) are particularly important to
          compete in the market for collateral management services. Their importance cannot
          be only evaluated on the basis of the volumes of feeds they represent. As regards the
          market definition, the Commission left open whether the market for collateral
          management services should be narrower, as it considers that the Transaction raises
          competition issues irrespective of the exact market definition. In addition, CCPs have
          a central role in relation to collateral management, as manager of counterparty risk,
          they decide where the collateral they request should be deposited. CCPs therefore
          cannot just be considered as one out of many counterparties.
   (684)  According to the Notifying Parties, the Statement of Objections also fails to address
          the differing significance of triparty and non-triparty repo transaction feeds to CMS,
          with only triparty repo feeds being a direct input for CMS and the proportion of
          triparty repo trade feeds provided by LCH.Clearnet to Euroclear Bank being de
          minimis.
   (685)  Contrary to the Notifying Parties' claim, while CMS is indeed embedded into triparty
          repo transactions, fixed income securities used in non-triparty repo transactions can
          be used and are used as collateral in various types of transactions including triparty
          repos, derivatives, etc. It is thus not correct to consider that only triparty repo feeds
          are an input for CMS.

   (686)     The Commission thus concludes that cleared fixed income (in particular repo)
             transaction feeds are an important input for the provision of collateral management
             services in the EEA.
   (687)     (I)CSDs and custodians provide custody services on the stock of securities they
             receive through settlement feeds. Customers also generally receive collateral
             management services from the same provider as the one providing settlement and
             custody services.500 Therefore, the fact that the merged entity will have the ability to
             foreclose access to cleared fixed income transaction feeds, as explained in Section
             8.4.4.2.1. will lead the merged entity to have the ability to foreclose access to an
             important input for the provision of collateral management.
   (688)     The fact that competing CMS providers would have no or reduced access to cleared
             repo transaction feeds will prevent them from effectively competing for CMS
             provided to large customers for which Euroclear and Clearstream in particular are
             close competitors.
   8.4.4.3.1.2. CCPs can also determine where collateral/margin is to be deposited
   (689)     In addition to having a determining role in the settlement process, CCPs decide
             where collateral (also called margin) should be put for transactions they clear.
   (690)     Article 47(3) of EMIR stipulates that "Financial instruments posted as margins or as
             default fund contributions shall, where available, be deposited with operators of
             securities settlement systems that ensure the full protection of those financial
             instruments. Alternatively, other highly secure arrangements with authorised
             financial institutions may be used." This article indicates that CCPs have the ability
             to decide where collateral should be held, providing a choice between securities
             settlement system operated by a CSD or other highly secure arrangements with
             authorised financial institutions. Those "highly secured arrangements for the deposit
             of financial instruments" or "maintaining cash" are further defined in Articles 44-45
             of the Commission Delegated Regulation501 and include, among others, an authorised
             credit institution as defined under Directive 2006/48/EC (i.e. including custodians
             holding banking licences). The European Securities and Markets Authority's
             ("ESMA") Q&A document on EMIR502 dated 6 June 2016 provided further
             clarification of these requirements, in particular as regards the question as to where
             to deposit financial instruments in case operators of securities settlement systems that
             ensure the full protection of those financial instruments would be unavailable.
   (691)     This lack of choice at clearing level and the impact on the downstream markets is
             also underlined by BNY Mellon that explains that: "The particular concerns that the
             proposed transaction raise relate to the combined importance of the CCPs in the
             merged group, to the current operation of a vertical silo by some entities of the
             merged group, and to the very limited number of locations at which Eurex Clearing
             currently holds collateral."503

   (692)     It follows from the above that the merged entity (and in particular LCH.Clearnet,
             since Eurex' collateral is deposited at Clearstream) would have the ability to require
             customers to deposit collateral currently posted at Euroclear and other
             CSDs/custodians to Clearstream. Since customers tend to trade to the extent possible
             with counterparties that have the same collateral management provider as they have
             (one explains for example that it "Reduces settlement risks, reduces (normally)
             settlement costs and settlement times (e.g.: pls. see aim to T2S)"504), the merged
             entity will have the ability to foreclose access to collateral related to repo
             transactions, and thus to important inputs for the provision of collateral management
             more generally. By being a central counterparty (and not one out of many
             counterparties), the decision of the CCP in this regard would have a direct impact on
             the decision of customers as to where they hold their assets under custody, and thus
             on the ability of other competitors to compete.
   (693)     In light of the above, the Commission considers that the merged entity would have
             the ability to foreclose access to important inputs for collateral management.
   8.4.4.3.2. The merged entity would have the incentive to foreclose access to important inputs
   for collateral management
   (694)     The location where collateral required by CCPs has to be posted and the location
             where settlement and custody should occur are closely related, as explained by the
             global custodian, BNY Mellon: "The decision by a CCP as to where it receives
             collateral affects market participants because they need to provide the collateral to
             the CCP. A market participant can hold a particular securities position in only one
             location at any one moment in time, so that if a market participant is obliged to hold
             a securities location in one location in order for it to be available as collateral for a
             CCP, this affects the location of that securities position for custody and for
             settlement purposes, and for the purposes of providing collateral to other market
             participants (when that securities position is used to collateralize exposures relating
             to other types of trading activity with other parties)."505 The merged entity will thus
             have the incentive to foreclose access to cleared repo transaction feeds and to require
             collateral to be deposited at Clearstream, because it is likely to increase its market
             share in collateral management further.
   (695)     In addition, the fact that custody and collateral management are characterised by
             economies of scale for customers will increase the incentive of the merged entity to
             foreclose access to important inputs, as customers will more likely move to
             Clearstream even if initially only a few decide to do so. Customers indeed generally
             try to aggregate assets, or at least asset classes that can be used in given types of
             transactions, with a limited number of (I)CSDs or custodians.506
   (696)     First, this reduces operational risks and costs associated with cross-system settlement
             and failed transactions, as described in Section 8.4.4.2.1.2. above.
   (697)     Second, it allows better availability of assets used as collateral, as it allows not to
             move collateral from one custody system to another when collateral should be used.

           the mobilisation of collateral and its optimal allocation for its clients."507 Customers
           in the market investigation also underline the importance of centralising collateral:
           "It is important for collateral centralization and optimization of operational
           processes (we have less movements to manage, thus the costs and operational risk
           diminish)."508; "flows and processes already in place with a specific CMS provider
           are just making a choice prevailing in order to exploit scale effects."509 This is
           particularly important for short-term repo transactions which are used by banks for
           financing purposes at the end of the day. Fully aggregating assets for a given
           business at one place may not always be possible, as certain CCPs such as Eurex for
           example require collateral to be posted in their system. Customers which do not have
           chosen Clearstream as their main custody/CMS provider but still want to benefit
           from the liquidity DBAG enjoys in certain markets can decide to keep some assets in
           Clearstream.
   (698)   This is also evidenced by the model of the global custodian Bank of New York
           Mellon: when it uses an intermediary in order to serve a given customer, it generally
           aggregates a given type of assets in the accounts of a given sub-custodian or ICSD,
           which facilitates and render more efficient its access ("Our standard model, both as a
           custodian and as a triparty agent, is that we hold securities issued in a specific issuer
           CSD either on accounts with that issuer CSD or on accounts with a sub-custodian
           that in turn holds accounts with that issuer CSD. With respect to international
           securities (i.e. securities for which Clearstream Banking Luxembourg and Euroclear
           Bank act jointly as issuer CSDs), and as a matter of standard practice, we hold
           securities on behalf of any one individual client with only one of the two ICSDs.")510
           This consolidation driver is also supported by explanations provided by the Notifying
           Parties in the Form CO, which indicate that assets used for collateral management
           can be used in various types of transactions: "For Clearstream, tri-party CMS is
           generally a standalone service and not limited to specific uses (such as repos or
           margin posting for derivatives). Standard umbrella collateral management service
           agreements (“CMSA”) support all services (securities lending, pledges with central
           banks, tri-party repos, collateralisation for loans, margin collateral, secured
           certificates)."511
   (699)   Therefore, because customers tend to aggregate collateral in one place and to trade
           with customers that have the same collateral management, the foreclosure strategy
           described above is likely to be beneficial for Clearstream, and thus provide
           Clearstream with the incentive to enter into a foreclosure strategy. BNY Mellon
           (global custodian) which competes in relation to collateral for uncleared transactions
           and is primarily active in relation to equities transactions fears that "the merged entity
           could limit the ability of BNY Mellon to provide collateral management to securities
           held in the merged entity’s CSDs".512 This is because the CCP can choose where
           collateral should be put and can thus induce additional "transaction costs and risks
           through external settlement or complexity" for customers.513 BNY Mellon also

            underlines the importance for customers to minimise the fragmentation of their
            collateral, the complexity of its management and the number of service providers
            involved: "[c]ustomers choose the collateral service provider on the basis of price
            and its ability to mobilise collateral in every direction (i.e. with any CCP or
            counterparty requiring margin for repo or derivative trades)."514 These different
            elements are likely to lead the merged entity to have incentives to foreclose access to
            important inputs for the provision of collateral management services.
   (700)    The incentive to foreclose competing CMS providers is true for all cleared repo
            transactions, but can also have a particular impact on the CMS for ATS traded CCP
            cleared triparty repo transactions where settlement and collateral management are
            directly linked. [BUSINESS SECRETS]. However, post-Transaction, the merged
            entity is unlikely to have the same incentives, as the lack of support or development
            to €GC Plus would benefit DBAG, as the market leader in the ATS traded and CCP
            cleared triparty repo market.
   (701)    In view of the foregoing, the Commission therefore considers that the merged entity
            would have the incentive to foreclose access to important inputs for collateral
            management.
   8.4.4.3.3. The Transaction would lead to a significant impediment to effective competition in
   the markets for collateral management
   (702)    Similarly to settlement and custody services (see Section 8.4.4.2.3.), Clearstream and
            Euroclear are particularly close competitors. This is also supported by the market
            investigation, as illustrated by BNY Mellon for example: "The main providers of
            collateral management services in Europe are JP Morgan, BNY Mellon, Clearstream
            Banking Luxembourg and Euroclear Bank."515
   (703)    The ability of custodians to compete relies on their ability to provide custody
            services for the largest amount of securities and to mobilise collateral in a maximum
            of transactions (either by category: equity transactions, i.e. equity and equities
            lending transactions; fixed income transactions, i.e. repos and bonds; derivatives, or
            for all types of transactions).516 The fact that neither Euroclear nor any other player
            would be able to effectively compete in the market for international settlement and
            custody services for fixed income will have a direct effect on their ability to have
            access to important inputs for providing collateral management, and thus on their
            ability to compete in the market for collateral management, in particular for large
            customers for which Clearstream, Euroclear and the global custodians compete more
            particularly. In addition, the fact that large customers in particular would switch part
            or all of their collateral management portfolio to Clearstream is likely to have an
            impact on smaller customers which benefit from network effects with these large
            customers and thus on the market for collateral management overall.
   (704)    In addition, global custodians already today face limitations in their ability to serve
            customers and compete efficiently with Euroclear and Clearstream, as they generally
            do not provide collateral management in relation to cleared transactions, as explained

            for example by BNY Mellon: "BNY Mellon offers similar collateral management
            services to, for example, Clearstream Bank Luxembourg. However, in Europe, BNY
            Mellon is restricted to provide CMS only for uncleared transaction types such as
            OTC repos, securities lending, initial margin for un-cleared derivatives
            instruments".517
   (705)    The fact that CCPs can decide where collateral should be put and that LSEG's
            clearing houses will have incentive to use Clearstream as in-house provider, will also
            further impede effective competition in collateral management, as Euroclear is, in
            combination with LCH.Clearnet, the only alternative to Eurex/Clearstream for the
            provision of collateral management for cleared repo transactions and thus the only
            player which can allow efficient use of collateral used by customers in all types of
            transactions (global custodians not being active in relation to cleared transactions).
            One customer indicates for example in this regard that, in case cleared repo trades
            settled in Euroclear were settled in Clearstream that "[it] would remove our
            possibility to move our activity from Clearstream to Euroclear in the future".518
   (706)    The fact that both Euroclear and Clearstream have a much larger collateral pool than
            the collateral they receive from CCPs, as argued by the Notifying Parties, does not
            take account of the importance of cleared repo transactions, in particular the fact that
            they involve dealers and large banks, as well as high quality liquid assets which are
            particularly important for collateral management, as they are accepted by all CCPs in
            various types of transactions.
   (707)    In addition, the Notifying Parties indicate in their response to the Decision opening
            the proceedings that LCH.Clearnet's triparty repo business is very small compared to
            Euroclear's CMS asset pool. Considering LCH.Clearnet's triparty repo business only
            excludes the cleared non-triparty repos transaction feeds, which also provide inputs
            for the provision of collateral management and does not take into account the fact
            that fixed income assets used in cleared repo transactions are particularly important
            for the provision of CMS in general. The size of LCH.Clearnet's triparty repo
            business in comparison with Euroclear's CMS asset pool is thus not representative of
            the importance of cleared repo transactions for the provision of CMS. The Notifying
            Parties also do not appear to make a distinction between asset that are under
            management of Euroclear or other competitors and assets effectively used as
            collateral in different transactions.
   (708)    In light of the above, the Commission therefore considers that the merger would lead
            to a significant impediment to effective competition in the market for collateral
            management services.
   8.4.4.3.4. Conclusion
   (709)    In view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the Transaction would lead
            to a significant impediment of effective competition in the market for CMS. This is
            because, in view of the Notifying Parties' de facto monopoly in the market for ATS
            traded and CCP cleared triparty repo clearing, in the market for ATS traded and CCP
            cleared triparty repo clearing and, to a lesser extent, in the market for CCP clearing

           of bonds, the merged entity would have the ability and incentive to foreclose
           competitors, and more particularly its closest competitor Euroclear, by diverting
           cleared repo transaction feeds and requiring customers to post collateral at
           Clearstream, which would prevent competitors from being able to effectively
           compete in the market. Euroclear being Clearstream's closest competitor and only
           other ICSD, it has a specific role in the competitive process taking place in the
           relevant markets. The foreclosure of Euroclear in particular but also other
           competitors (which already today generally do not hold collateral received by CCPs
           and are less active than the two ICSDs in relation to CMS related to fixed income)
           would thus have a significant impact on competition on the relevant markets.
   9.      FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES
   9.1.    Introduction to financial derivatives and Notifying Parties' activities
   (710)   In its decision in DBAG/NYSE Euronext, the Commission identified separate markets
           for derivatives according to the underlying asset class, distinguishing between
           interest rates derivatives,519 single equity derivatives,520 and equity index
           derivatives.521
   (711)   In addition, in the same decision, the Commission also distinguished derivatives
           according to the execution mode, separating exchange traded derivatives (ETDs)
           predominantly in the form of futures and options and derivatives traded OTC often in
           the form of swaps.522 This distinction had been reconsidered in Intercontinental
           Exchange/NYSE Euronext523 but was ultimately left open in this case.
   (712)   Finally the Commission has previously considered a possible distinction between
           different types of contracts but left this question finally open. Within exchange
           traded contracts this related specifically to futures and options.524
   (713)   The market definition stemming from these past decisions is not contested by the
           Notifying Parties in this case.525
   9.1.1.  Regulatory background
   (714)   As indicated in Section 5.2.3. of this Decision, the regulatory background is an
           important backdrop to the assessment of the effects of this case. Specifically, open
           access provisions in the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments repealing
           Directive 2004/39/EC ("MiFID II")526 and the Regulation on Markets in Financial
           Instruments ("MiFIR"),527 which aim at mitigating some of the obstacles resulting
           from the network effects discussed in Section 5.2.1. above and further promote
           competition between exchanges are particularly relevant in the area of derivatives.

   (715)   The rules pertaining to open access with regard to exchange traded derivatives are
           Articles 35 and 36 of MIFIR, dealing with access to CCPs by trading venues and
           access to trading venues by CCPs respectively. These rules are further specified in
           regulatory technical standards (RTS). The two relevant RTSs for the access regime
           are RTS 15 dealing with access to trading venues and to CCPs528 and RTS 16 dealing
           with access to benchmarks.529
   (716)   Access can be of two kinds: access of one or more trading venues to a CCP and
           access of multiple CCPs to a trading venue.
   (717)   A regime that guarantees access to a CCP by multiple trading venues is designed to
           allow competing trading venues to benefit from the netting efficiencies of the host
           CCP the same way as the incumbent trading venue. In such a system the competing
           trading venue can list a contract identical to the one traded on the incumbent venue
           and traders would be able to open a position on one trading venue and close it out on
           the other given that all such contracts are cleared at the same clearing house.
   (718)   Access to a trading venue by one or multiple CCPs gives them the possibility to
           compete with the CCP of the incumbent exchange without having to overcome the
           network and scale effects resulting from the incumbent's liquidity advantage. The
           implementation of these rules will make it more difficult for trading venues to
           exclude competing CCPs from accessing their trade feeds. This can be an important
           step to foster competition between CCPs.
   (719)   According to the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, in assessing the competitive effects
           of a merger, the Commission may in some circumstances take account of future
           changes to the market that can be reasonably predicted.530 In this context it has to be
           taken into account that MiFID II and MiFIR were adopted by the European
           Parliament on 15 April 2014, by the Council of the European Union on 13 May 2014
           and published in the EU Official Journal on 12 June 2014. There is therefore no
           uncertainty about the general shape of the regulation, even if application of the open
           access regime is not yet fully effective. The applicability of MIFID II and MIFIR
           was postponed by one year compared to the original timetable from January 2017 to
           January 2018. In addition, based on Article 54 of MIFIR, CCPs and trading venues
           may submit an application to their competent regulators for permission to avail
           themselves of a transitory regime that can last up to an additional thirty months.
           Therefore, depending on the decision of the relevant national regulators, which have
           certain discretion on the matter, the rules on access will be applicable at latest in July
           2020.
   (720)   While the absence of administrative and industry practice makes it difficult to predict
           accurately how the rules will be applied in practice, the upcoming regulation is an
           important step towards more competitive clearing markets in Europe and is likely to
           reshape the current functioning of the markets.

            and options based on various underlying asset classes.
   (722)    As regards clearing, Eurex Clearing provides CCP services for exchange-traded
            derivatives executed on the Eurex Exchange (including off-order book trades) in a
            vertically integrated structure as well as clearing of OTC traded instruments.
   (723)    LSEG offers trading services for derivatives on the LSE Derivatives Market (LSE
            DM). This trading venue offers trading of derivatives on interest rates, single stock
            equity and indices as well as depository receipts. It also offers trading of derivatives
            listed on Oslo Børs.
   (724)    Through its Italian operations of Borsa Italiana, LSEG operates the Italian
            Derivatives Market (IDEM) offering on-book trading and trade entry services for off-
            book trading on a portfolio of Italian and other European equity and related index
            derivatives.
   (725)    LSEG is active in the clearing of derivatives through LCH.Clearnet. It is particularly
            strong in clearing of OTC traded IR derivatives via its SwapClear service. Clearing
            of FX derivatives is offered via ForexClear, and Credit Default Swaps ("CDS") via
            CDSClear.
   (726)    LCH.Clearnet also provides merchant clearing services to non-vertically integrated
            trading venues, namely Euronext, Nasdaq’s NLX,532 and Oslo Børs. In Italy, LSEG
            operates Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia ("CC&G") which provides clearing of
            derivatives contracts traded on IDEM.
   9.2.     Market definition
   9.2.1.   General criteria
   (727)    In line with its previous decisions, the Commission considers that derivatives
            contracts can be distinguished based on underlying asset classes, execution
            environment, and types of contracts. These general criteria considered in the relevant
            case law are first introduced, before the relevant product markets in this case are
            discussed in detail, namely trading and clearing of exchange traded interest rate
            derivatives, clearing of OTC traded interest rate derivatives, and trading and clearing
            of single stock equity derivatives.
   9.2.1.1. Distinction based on underlying asset class
   (728)    Based on the type of the underlying variable or asset, derivatives can be categorised
            into equity derivatives (single stock or index based), interest rate derivatives,
            currency derivatives, different types of commodity derivatives, credit derivatives,
            and foreign exchange (FX) derivatives.
   (729)    In its previous decisions the Commission concluded that in relation to exchange
            traded derivatives, different asset classes belong to different markets. This
            conclusion was based on the fact that from a demand-side perspective, the different
   531
           Eurex operates the derivatives exchange Eurex Deutschland and it holds all of the shares in Eurex
           Clearing AG (“Eurex Clearing”), which is the clearing-house within DBAG.

             types of risks associated with the different asset classes are not substitutable in a
             meaningful way.533 For instance, an exposure to foreign exchange risk cannot be
             hedged with an interest rate derivative or a single stock equity derivative contract.
   (730)     This finding is further supported by supply-side considerations. Although any
             exchange or clearing house could start offering products belonging to an asset class it
             does not currently offer, it is unlikely to be able to do this with the immediacy
             required for supply-side substitution. First, in a new asset class the regulatory
             approvals take much more time than within the asset class where the exchange is
             already present. Second, establishing a clearing framework for a new asset class
             takes much more time than doing so for an additional instrument belonging to an
             asset class the provider is already active in. For example, in a new asset class the
             exchange does not have the underlying historical data that is necessary for risk
             management and has to obtain such data from another source. Devising a risk model,
             testing it and adapting the risk management systems take also take more time in a
             new asset class than in the asset class the exchange has already significant expertise
             in. Third, given that in a new asset class the exchange cannot offer margin offsets,
             the launch of the product inevitably results in a weaker constraint on competitors
             than a product launch within the same asset class.
   (731)     Therefore, for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission considers that the
             relevant derivatives markets should be defined along the underlying asset class.
   9.2.1.2. Role of the execution environment
   (732)     In the decision DBAG/NYSE Euronext the Commission concluded that exchange-
             traded derivatives and derivatives traded OTC constitute separate product markets in
             view of their different characteristics, complementary nature and lack of
             substitutability except for a small portion of ETD-lookalikes.534
   (733)     While exchange traded derivatives (mainly futures and options) are only available in
             predefined bundles of trading and clearing, OTC traded derivatives are characterised
             by an unbundled offering. Indeed, OTC derivatives can be traded either on electronic
             OTC platforms, or purely bi-laterally and they can be cleared or not.
   (734)     The post-crisis regulatory initiatives have introduced significant changes with regard
             to the way OTC derivatives are transacted. Namely, EMIR535 prescribes that
             standardised and relatively liquid OTC derivatives must be centrally cleared.536 The
             mandating of CCP clearing is usually referred to as the clearing obligation. MiFID

             II537 and MiFIR538 further provide that certain centrally cleared derivatives must be
             traded on organised trading platforms with pre-trade and post-trade transparency.
             The obligation to trade these derivatives on transparent trading platforms is referred
             to as the trading obligation. The clearing and trading obligations will be gradually
             phased in through delegated acts in the coming years. These delegated acts specify
             the entry into force of the trading and the clearing obligation for the different types of
             derivatives and different types of counterparties.539 In anticipation of the regulatory
             reforms the majority of OTC derivatives are by now centrally cleared.
   (735)     In its previous decisions, the Commission considered that, contrary to ETD
             derivatives where products are always traded in bundles including trading and
             clearing, OTC derivatives are different. Specifically, in Deutsche Börse / NYSE
             Euronext the Commission found that a separate market could exist for the provision
             of clearing services for third party platforms, including OTC platforms.540 This
             consideration was also recalled in Intercontinental Exchange Group / NYSE
             Euronext, without, however, a definitive conclusion.541
   (736)     This is based on the fact that contrary to the exchange-traded derivatives model, in
             the current model of OTC trading, OTC trading venues are connected to several
             CCPs; counterparties often have a separate relationship with the CCP (and choice
             thereof) independently of the execution mechanism (trading platform or voice). The
             Commission therefore concludes, for the purposes of this Decision, that clearing and
             trading services for OTC interest rate derivatives are provided separately and form
             separate markets.
   (737)     Therefore, for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission considers that the
             relevant derivatives markets should be defined along the execution environment.
   9.2.1.3. Types of derivatives contracts
   (738)     The three main types of derivatives contracts are options, futures/forwards and
             swaps. Options may be traded OTC or on-exchange.
   (739)     An option is a contract between two counterparties under which one counterparty
             (the option buyer) acquires the right (against the payment of a premium), but not the
             obligation, to buy from, or sell to, the other counterparty (the option seller) a specific
             amount of the underlying asset at a specific "strike price" on or before a specified
             date.
   (740)     A future/forward is a contract between two counterparties under which one party, the
             seller, agrees to sell to the other counterparty (the buyer) a specified amount of the
   537
           Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in
           financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast), OJ L
           173, 12.6.2014 p. 349.

           credit default swaps (CDS) the relevant delegated act is Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)

            underlying asset (or its cash equivalent) at a specified future date at a price agreed at
            the time of the conclusion of the contract. The difference between a future and
            forward is that futures are traded on organised exchanges whereas forwards are
            privately negotiated.
   (741)    A swap is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange a sequence of cash
            flows over a period of time. These cash flows could for example be tied to the value
            of fixed or floating interest rates (IRS) or to the value of foreign currencies (FX
            swaps).542 Swaps are typically OTC traded instruments.543
   (742)    In the DBAG / NYSE Euronext decision, the Commission concluded that swaps do
            not belong to the same product market as options and futures.544 This was based on
            the different characteristics of the instruments, the different purposes they are used
            for, and the different execution environments. In this case, the market investigation
            did not reveal any reason to challenge this conclusion.
   (743)    Therefore, for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission considers that a
            separate relevant market for swaps exists. The question of whether options and
            futures should be considered separately can be left open for the purposes of this
            Decision as it does not affect the Commission's competitive assessment.
   9.2.2.   Exchange traded interest rate derivatives
   (744)    Exchange traded interest rate derivatives encompass futures and options based on
            either short term money market rates like Euribor (STIR derivatives) or capital
            markets usually built on sovereign bonds like Bund or Bobl (LTIR derivatives). In
            the decision Deutsche Börse / NYSE Euronext, the Commission noted that in spite of
            an uncontested distinction between these two far ends of the yield curve, there is still
            a continuum of maturities along the interest rate yield curve for which a clear
            delineating criterion would be difficult to define.545 The Commission therefore
            considered that a split along the nature of the interest rate underlying and their place
            on the yield curve might not fully reflect the reality in these markets; however, the
            Commission finally left the question of a possible distinction along these lines
            open.546
   (745)    The Notifying Parties use the capital markets (LTIR) vs. money market (STIR)
            distinction for the calculation of market shares547 but do not claim these two
            segments should be analysed as separate markets.548 In any event, the exact product
            market definition in interest rate derivatives can also be left open in the present case
            as it does not change the competitive assessment.
   542
          Two other types of swaps are credit default swaps and total return swaps.
   543
          The Commission also notes that there is a development bringing standardised swaps with a Market
          Agreed Coupon ("MAC") and standardised International Monetary Market ("IMM") dates on exchange.

   (746)   Therefore, for the purposes of this Decision, the question of whether the market for
           trading and clearing of European interest rate derivatives should be further sub-
           segmented into STIR and LTIR can be left open as it does not affect the
           Commission's competitive assessment in relation to interest rate derivatives.
   9.2.3.  Clearing of interest rate derivatives traded OTC
   (747)   OTC derivatives are derivatives that are traded away from exchange and include
           interest rate derivatives (IRD), credit derivatives, foreign exchange (FX) derivatives,
           equity derivatives and commodity derivatives. IRD make up 82% of the outstanding
           notional amount of OTC derivatives, while FX derivatives, credit derivatives549 and
           equity derivatives make up 14%, 3%, and 1% of total outstanding notional
           respectively.550 IRD include interest rate swaps (IRS), forward rate agreements and
           overnight index swaps. By far the most commonly traded IRD is IRS, which makes
           up nearly three quarters of IRD outstanding notional amount as at 1H of 2015.551
   (748)   As regards distinguishing separate markets according to asset classes (interest rate
           derivatives, credit derivatives etc.), the above conclusion552 also applies to OTC
           derivatives, given that the different types of risks are not interchangeable irrespective
           of the execution environment. From a demand-side perspective, clearing an interest
           rate derivative product cannot be substituted with the clearing of a credit derivative.
           The clearing of different classes of OTC derivatives is to be distinguished by asset
           class from a demand perspective.
   (749)   As to the supply-side substitutability, CCPs that clear derivatives in one asset class
           are likely to have or build capabilities to offer clearing of another asset class building
           on their existing workflows. At the same time, there are several hurdles that make it
           difficult for a CCP to move rapidly into another asset classes, such as obtaining
           regulatory approvals, devising a risk model, obtaining the underlying data for risk
           management, and building out the right connectivity. All of this takes more time in a
           new asset class than doing the same in respect of different products within the same
           asset class. This is also evidenced by the fact that different players control margin
           pools of different OTC derivatives: ICE holds CDS while LCH.Clearnet holds IRS.
           Due to these factors, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of this
           Decision, the relevant market in relation to OTC clearing should be subdivided
           according to asset classes.
   (750)   Therefore, for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission considers that the
           relevant product market is the market for CCP clearing of interest rate derivatives
           traded OTC.
   9.2.4.  Single stock equity derivatives
   (751)   Equity derivatives are contracts that derive their value from price movement of
           underlying equity stocks (i.e. shares). These types of instruments are used by market
           participants to reallocate the risk of price changes due to market movements of the
           underlying equities. Exchange-traded equity derivatives are always cleared by a
           central counter party ("CCP") which is pre-selected by the trading venue so that

          traders can only chose a fixed bundle containing both services.553 In general,
          exchange traded equity derivatives can be distinguished by the type of instrument
          and the type of underlying. With regards to the relevant instrument, a differentiation
          between options and futures can be considered.
   (752)  Exchange traded single stock equity futures and options are comparable instruments.
          While options confer a right to buy (or sell) an underlying at the prearranged price on
          the fixed date, futures do not confer a right of choice, leading to a linear pay-off
          structure. Both types of instruments can be financially or physically settled. For
          futures, the physical settlement is not typical because traders tend to close out
          positions before expiry date.
   (753)  Considering the type of underlying, a basic distinction can be made between index
          based products that are linked to a number of equities and single stock equity
          derivatives, deriving their value from the price movement of one specific underlying
          stock. For the case at hand, only single stock equity derivatives are relevant.
   (754)  In its previous decision, the Commission also considered that single stock derivatives
          could be subdivided according to the individual stock or comprise a wider set of
          stocks up to a level of single stock derivatives based on any European underlying.
   (755)  The results of the market investigation further confirmed that single stock equity
          derivatives on specific national underlyings cannot be directly substituted with other
          instruments from a buy-side perspective. Such a stock-specific market could be
          supported by responses to the market investigation from the buy-side which state that
          "single stocks derivatives are more efficient ways to get exposure to an issuer
          compared to cash equities".554 In addition, one market participant specified that:
          "Because our investment strategy is “fundamental” (i.e. we examine for each
          company its financial statements, health, competitors and markets looking at
          historical and present data to make financial forecasts), our investment decisions are
          company specific."555 This indicates a separate market of single stock equity
          derivatives which would be significantly smaller than one market comprising all
          EEA underlyings.
   (756)  However, the Commission has already considered in DBAG / NYSE Euronext, that a
          market definition on a "per contract" basis would be inappropriate, given that
          customers implement trading strategies556 and do not only invest in only one single
          contract557 but ultimately left this question open.558 The market investigation in this
          case showed a mixed result as regards the scope of such trading strategies. Some
          market participants consider a specifically national strategy, that could be seen as an
          indication for "home bias"; in this particular case an Italian focus: "Basically (and
          mainly), our strategies are implemented by looking at the single stock derivatives
          level quoted on the Italian market."559 Such a view would be further supported by
          respondents that could not identify any instruments traded on exchange that could be

            used as substitutes for single stock equity derivatives on Italian underlyings.560 One
            participants summarised that "non-linear or forward risk on Italian single stocks can
            only be mitigated via Italian single stock equity derivatives".561
   (757)    The restriction of investment strategies to single stock equity derivatives based on
            underlyings from just one country is however not a commonly shared view of all
            buy-side market participants. Rather, other criteria like specific industry sector or
            larger regional criteria including EEA-wide focus have also been considered by some
            respondents from the buy side.562
   (758)    From a sell-side perspective, results were also mixed, giving strong indications for
            markets based on national underlyings but also mentioning a range of other criteria,
            including a common market for any EEA based single stock equity.563
   (759)    The same holds true for the supply-side, where some exchanges (typically the
            historic national incumbents) tend to serve national clients while pan-European
            players focus on more international investors. However, the clear delineation
            between both groups is not clear cut.
   (760)    Therefore, for the purposes of this Decision, the Commission considers that the
            relevant product market is the market for trading and clearing of single stock equity
            derivatives. The question of whether the market should be further segmented based
            on the nationality of the underlying can be left open for the purposes of this Decision
            as it does not affect the Commission's competitive assessment in relation to single
            stock equity derivatives.
   9.2.5.   Geographic market definitions
   9.2.5.1. Trading and clearing of exchange traded interest rate derivatives
   (761)    As regards all types of exchange traded derivatives discussed above, the geographic
            scope of the relevant markets is likely to be at least EEA-wide. This is in line with
            the relevant precedents,564 as well as the Notifying Parties' submission.
   9.2.5.2. CCP clearing of OTC interest rate derivatives
   (762)    The Commission has not in the past considered geographic market definition for
            clearing of OTC derivatives.
   (763)    The Notifying Parties submit that the relevant geographic market should encompass
            all CCPs authorised to provide OTC clearing services worldwide. This is based on
            the claim that the demand-side of the market consist of major financial institutions
            with a global presence and are clearing members at multiple venues. In addition,
            regulatory aspects are harmonised based on equivalence.
   (764)    Within the EEA competition takes place within the same regulatory framework,
            under similar conditions and irrespective of the location of the CCP within the EEA.

            regions. In addition, a number of third country CCPs have been recognized as
            authorised CCPs to provide clearing services to users in the EU under the
            equivalence regime.565
   (765)    However, third country CCPs (even those under the equivalent regime) often have a
            different geographic focus and not all customers in the EEA consider them as viable
            alternatives to which they could switch within a short time. In this regard, the market
            investigation produced a nuanced picture. While one large international bank stated
            that "Nationality is not a factor" for the selection of a CCP,566 other respondents
            mentioned regulatory differences as relevant aspects for the selection of a CCP for
            IRS clearing. One bank also responded to prefer "to have the CCPs and
            counterparties under the same regulatory regime for the time being" but considered
            "investigating other possibilities in the future".567
   (766)    Also some buy-side participants stated to prefer "to benefit from similar regulatory
            and risk environment" or to stay to one regulatory environment because some their
            clients "prefer not to take cross border risk".568 The Notifying Parties' claim that
            large institutions are typically members to several clearing venues could also be seen
            as an indicator for the fact that several clearing houses in different jurisdictions are
            not substitutable, otherwise the incentive for multiple memberships should be
            significantly reduced.
   (767)    On the other hand, the results to the market investigation also reveal that market
            participants at least monitor the development of other CCPs outside Europe, namely
            CME.569
   (768)    Therefore, the Commission considers that, for the purposes of this Decision, the
            relevant geographic market for CCP clearing services for OTC traded interest rate
            derivatives is at least EEA-wide in scope.
   9.2.5.3. Trading and clearing of single stock equity derivatives
   (769)    Concerning Exchange traded European single stock equity options and futures the
            decision DBAG/NYSE Euronext concluded that customers of European exchanges are
            located around the world. However it also considered that from the supply-side
            European exchanges tend to be better placed to offer derivatives contracts based on
            European single stocks.570 In sum, the Commission left the precise geographic
            market definition open.
   (770)    The evidence gathered in the case at hand does not provide anything which would
            require a change of the market definition. From a demand-side, both clients with a
            slightly more local investment focus coexist with truly global investors. The same
            holds true for the sell-side, where banks and dealer with some kind of national focus
            compete with large international players.

           country CCPs recognised to offer services in the EU under the equivalence regime can be found online

   9.3.      Competitive assessment
   9.3.1.    Exchange-traded interest rate derivatives
   9.3.1.1. Market structure and the main players
   (772)     In the area of EUR-denominated exchange-traded interest rate derivatives, there are
             two main players, Eurex and ICE.
   (773)     In an overall market for exchange-traded interest rate derivatives (comprising both
             LTIR and STIR), Eurex holds a market share of [50-60%] in terms of the number of
             contracts traded. ICE is the second-largest player with [40-50%] of the market in
             contracts traded.571
   (774)     In a possible segmentation between long- and short-term interest rate derivatives,572
             Eurex and ICE are the respective market leaders on the two sides of this divide. In
             the LTIR derivatives market, Eurex has in excess of [90-100%] of the market in
             LTIR derivatives with its flagship Bund, Bobl and Schatz products.573 In the EUR-
             based STIR market, the situation is reverse: ICE holds in excess of [90-100%] of the
             market with CurveGlobal and Eurex both having minimal volumes.574
   (775)     Remaining competitors in the market previously included NLX, who used to trade
             both LTIR and STIR, but recently exited the market.575 Moreover, there is the recent
             entrant CurveGlobal, who offers for trading both LTIR and STIR.
   (776)     CurveGlobal is a joint venture between LSEG, CBOE and seven dealer banks,
             namely Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Goldman
             Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Société Générale. The shareholder structure is indicated in
             Table 3 below.576 CurveGlobal was launched in October 2016577 and currently offers
             for trading (and clearing) the equivalents to the flagship interest rate futures of ICE
             (STIR futures, namely Short Sterling, and EURIBOR and LTIR Gilts futures) and
             Eurex (namely LTIR futures, such as Bund, Bobl and Schatz futures).
   (777)     CurveGlobal employs LSEG's LSE DM trading infrastructure. [BUSINESS

   9.3.1.2. Commission's preliminary view in the Statement of Objections
   (778)    In the Statement of Objections, the Commission took the preliminary view that the
            Transaction would lead to a significant impediment of effective competition in the
            market for exchange-traded derivatives by likely eliminating CurveGlobal, a
            particularly well-placed competitor to challenge Eurex's strong position in LTIR
            derivatives. The Statement of Objections considered that CurveGlobal – despite
            being a recent entrant with a very small current presence – would be a particularly
            well-placed competitor to challenge Eurex's strong position in LTIR derivatives. Two
            of the main reasons for the Commission to reach this preliminary view were that
            CurveGlobal could attract customers by offering significant cross-margining benefits
            between exchange-traded and OTC-traded interest rate derivatives and that
            CurveGlobal benefitted from dealer support.
   9.3.1.3. Notifying Parties' view
   (779)    In their response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties main
            arguments evolved about the allegedly overstated importance of CurveGlobal as a
            competitive constraint on Eurex.
   (780)    The Notifying Parties in particular contested the Commission's view that cross
            margining is a key factor in the competition between CurveGlobal and Eurex, which
            makes CurveGlobal a uniquely placed to challenge Eurex' position. To underpin
            [THE PARTIES VIEW IN RELATION TO] cross-margining [NOT BEING A
            RELEVANT COMPETITION FACTOR UNDER CURRENT MARKET
            CONDITIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXISTING REGULATORY
            FRAMEWORK],            the     Notifying      Parties      submitted   [ADDITIONAL
            QUANTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS].579 These studies aim to
            demonstrate that cross-margining has limited competitive relevance in the market
            under consideration [BUSINESS SECRETS].
   (781)    As regards differentiating factors other than cross-margining, the Notifying Parties
            consider that the other attributes of CurveGlobal which the Statement of Objections
            lists (dealer support, market maker support, low explicit fees, and access to the
            platform, i.e. membership base and connectivity) are not unique characteristics. Such
            factors are either easily replicable or are actually offered by other market
            participants. Specifically, the Notifying Parties consider that dealer support is not a
            decisive competitive advantage, and in any case not unique to CurveGlobal, since
            dealers can decide to support other platforms as well. The same applies to market
            maker support, which is simply the result of the incentives offered to specialized
            market maker firms. These incentive schemes can be replicated by any other
            platform and, in themselves, are insufficient to move liquidity, which is
            demonstrated by the example of NLX. The Notifying Parties point out that NLX's
            temporary success in winning minor market shares was the result of its generous
            incentive scheme, which resulted in market maker trades with the sole purpose of
            receiving cash incentives, but failed to attract any real liquidity.
   (782)    In summary, the Notifying Parties consider that the Commission's characterization of
            CurveGlobal as being uniquely placed to challenge Eurex position is inconsistent
            with the reality of competition in this market. CurveGlobal, according to the
EN                                                149                                               EN

            Notifying Parties, is neither a unique competitor, nor does it place a strong constraint
            on Eurex.
   (783)    The Notifying Parties also argued that the Statement of Objections significantly
            underestimates the value proposition of ICE and thus the constraint that it exercises
            on Eurex. In addition, according to the Notifying Parties CME is also at least as well-
            placed (if not better-placed) than CurveGlobal as an alternative to Eurex.
   9.3.1.4. The Commission's assessment
   (784)    The Commission has carefully considered the Notifying Parties' arguments and the
            evidence presented in their response to the Statement of Objections, including the
            [QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES PROVIDED IN RELATION TO CROSS-
            MARGINING].580
   (785)    However, the question of whether the Transaction gives rise to a significant
            impediment of effective competition in the market for trading and clearing of
            exchange-traded interest rate derivatives can be left open for the purposes of this
            Decision, as the overall assessment of the case would not change. This is because, as
            explained in Section 11, the remedies submitted by the Notifying Parties are
            insufficient to solve competition concerns in the markets for CCP clearing of bonds,
            for ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos, ATS traded and CCP cleared non-
            triparty repos, as well as on the markets for settlement and custody services in
            relation to fixed income provided by ICSDs and large custodians and for collateral
            management.
   9.3.2.    Clearing of interest rate derivatives traded OTC
   9.3.2.1. Market structure
   (786)    LSEG is present in the market through LCH.Clearnet's SwapClear service and
            DBAG is active in OTC IRD clearing via Eurex's OTC clearing service, Eurex OTC
            Clear.
   (787)    LSEG is currently the market leader in clearing of OTC IRD clearing through
            LCH.Clearnet (SwapClear), while DBAG launched EurexOTC Clear in late 2012 as
            a direct competitor. As of April 2016 the open interest (in EUR trillion) on the

   (788)     In its Statement of Objections, the Commission preliminary considered that the
             Transaction is likely to lead to a significant impediment of effective competition as it
             would eliminate EurexOTC Clear, SwapClear's most credible competitor in Europe,
             This finding was based on the following considerations:
   (789)     Even though EurexOTC Clear has not attracted any relevant market share since its
             launch in 2013, the Commission considered there were still significant volumes of
             uncleared transactions for which EurexOTC Clear would be well-positioned.
   (790)     In addition, the Commission considered that EurexOTC Clear had all necessary
             attributes to become a successful challenger for SwapClear. This finding was based
             on the understanding that EurexOTC Clear has a realistic chance to attract liquidity
             based on the advantages it can generate for its clients in terms of capital efficiency,
             margin savings, lower membership criteria, asset protection and range of accepted
             collateral, as well as its attractive fee model.
   (791)     The Commission also considered that EurexOTC Clear had a realistic chance to
             attract further dealer support and is perceived by LCH.Clearnet as a relevant
             competitive threat and close competitor. In addition, the Commission also considered
             that LCH.Clearnet had already reacted to the competitive threat posed by EurexOTC
             Clear.
   9.3.2.3. Notifying Parties' view
   (792)     First and foremost the Notifying Parties claim that EurexOTC Clear is [NOTIFYING
             PARTIES' ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT COMMERCIAL SITUATION]. As a
             result, and due to the network effects inherent in derivatives trading and clearing, the
             Notifying Parties argue that [NOTIFYING PARTIES' ASSESSMENT OF
             RELEVANT MARKET CHARACTERISTICS] "tipping" of the market is highly
             unlikely.582

   (793)     The Notifying Parties further claim that EurexOTC Clear has [BUSINESS
             SECRETS].583
   (794)     The Notifying Parties also disagree with the Commission's preliminary finding in the
             Statement of Objections about the future prospects of EurexOTC Clear and dismiss
             the argument that significant uncleared volumes exist that EurexOTC Clear could
             attract. According to the Notifying Parties, additional potential for further growth
             does not exist as suggested by the Commission. First, cross-currency swaps are not
             relevant [BUSINESS SECRETS].584 Similarly, Swaptions are not relevant

   (796)     Finally, the Notifying Parties argue that the most credible constraint on SwapClear
             resides in the [BUSINESS SECRETS].587
   9.3.2.4. The Commission's assessment
   (797)     The Commission has carefully considered the Notifying Parties' arguments and the
             evidence presented in their response to the Statement of Objections, including the
             [QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES PROVIDED IN RELATION TO CROSS-
             MARGINING].588
   (798)     However, the question of whether the Transaction gives rise to a significant
             impediment of effective competition in the market for clearing of interest rate
             derivatives traded OTC can be left open for the purposes of this Decision, as the
             overall assessment of the case would not change. This is because, as explained in
             Section 11, the remedies submitted by the Notifying Parties are insufficient to solve
             competition concerns in the markets for CCP clearing of bonds, for ATS traded and
             CCP cleared triparty repos, ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos, as well
             as on the markets for settlement and custody services in relation to fixed income
             provided by ICSDs and large custodians and for collateral management.
   9.3.3.    Single stock equity derivatives
   (799)     The Commission assesses in this section the overlap between the Notifying Parties in
             the market for trading and clearing of single stock equity derivatives. The market
             definition left open if the relevant product market comprises single stock equities
             based on national underlyings only or includes contracts based on any EEA
             underlying.

           The Notifying Parties also argue that there are a number of other CCPs that are at least as well placed as
           Eurex OTC Clear to exert competitive pressure on the merged entity, namely JSCC, HKEX, SGX, and
           ASX which are all approved to clearing OTC IRD in Europe, pursuant to equivalence decisions. While
           the Notifying Parties recognise that these CCPs do not have an equivalent presence to CME or LCH,
           they nonetheless exercise a relevant competitive constraint for clearing OTC IRD given the global
           nature of the market.

   (800)    It is recalled that from a horizontal perspective, it has to be taken into account that
            the Notifying Parties do not only compete for trading of single stock equity
            derivatives separately but rather for the combined offer of trading and clearing of
            these products. The complementarity of trading and clearing components is
            characterised by competition between service bundles, or bundle-to-bundle
            competition.589 This finding is relevant for all exchange traded derivatives where
            market participants cannot buy trading and clearing services separately from each
            other; it is however particularly relevant in the market for trading and clearing of
            single stock equity derivatives in light of actual market structure.
   (801)    DBAG offers vertically integrated trading/clearing bundles for single stock equity
            derivatives based on a number of national underlyings, comprising both DBAG's
            trading services (Eurex Trading) and DBAG's clearing services (Eurex Clearing).
   (802)    In the area of single stock derivatives, two types of horizontal overlaps arise: first an
            overlap in single stock equity derivatives based on Italian underlyings where LSEG
            is present through the Italian home market exchange, IDEM, and Eurex is a
            competitor, and second in single stock equity derivatives based on French, Dutch,
            Belgian, and Portuguese underlyings where DBAG competes with Euronext's
            bundles comprising trading services on its own venues and LSEG's clearing services
            provided by LCH.Clearnet SA.
   9.3.3.1. Italian single stock equity derivatives
   9.3.3.1.1 Market structure
   (803)    In case separate product markets for single stock equity derivatives based on the
            nationality of the underlying existed, a horizontal overlap arises in the market for
            Italian single stock equity derivatives. In such a scenario IDEM as part of Borsa
            Italiana (and therefore LSEG) is the incumbent exchange with a strong local
            presence while Eurex with its pan-European offer of single stock equity derivatives
            could be a relevant competitor.
   (804)    In 2015 [BUSINESS SECRETS] Italian single stock futures were traded on Eurex
            and [BUSINESS SECRETS] on IDEM; in the same time, [BUSINESS SECRETS]
            Italian single stock options were traded on Eurex and [BUSINESS SECRETS] on
            IDEM.590 During the same period, ICE reports 1.4 million trades in Italian single
            stock and dividend futures and 0.7 million trades in Italian single stock options.591
            Based on this data, IDEM has a market share of [50-60%] in the overall market for
            Italian single stock equity derivatives and Eurex a share of [30-40%]. ICE was able
            to grow its market share to almost [5-10%] . In case of separate markets for futures
            and options, IDEM would be particularly strong in the latter with over [70-80%]
            market shares while its presence is more limited in futures with only [20-30%]
            market shares.592 In this market segment, Eurex is the market leader with over [60-
            70%] market shares, while ICE accounts for [10-20%].

   9.3.3.1.2 Commission's preliminary view in the Statement of objections
   (805)     In the Statement of Objections the Commission took a preliminary view that the
             Transaction would lead to a significant impediment of effective competition in the
             market for Italian single stock equity derivatives based the high combined market
             shares, and the absence of other competitors that could replicate the competition
             constraints the Parties currently exercise upon each other. This was supported by a
             preliminary assessment that the Transaction could eliminate the cheapest competitor
             in the market.
   9.3.3.1.3 Notifying Parties' view
   (806)     The Notifying Parties claim that Eurex' main competitor in the market for Italian
             single stock equity derivatives is not LSEG. They argue that [ASSESSMENT OF
             IDEM'S POSITIONING IN THE MARKET]. The offerings are therefore in the
             Notifying Parties' view complementarity. Moreover, the Notifying Parties submitted
             [ASSESSMENT OF IDEM'S POSITIONING IN THE MARKET]. Finally,
             according to the Notifying Parties, other actual and/or potential competitors, namely
             ICE and Euronext will continue to be present and constrain the merged entity.
   9.3.3.1.4 The Commission's assessment
   (807)     The Commission has carefully considered the Notifying Parties' arguments and the
             evidence presented in the response to the Statement of Objections.
   (808)     However, the question of whether the Transaction gives rise to a significant
             impediment of effective competition in the market for trading and clearing of single
             stock equity derivatives based on Italian underlyings can be left open for the purpose
             of this Decision, as the overall assessment of the case would not change. This is
             because, as explained in Section 11, the remedies submitted by the Notifying Parties
             are insufficient to solve competition concerns in the markets for CCP clearing of
             bonds, for ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos, ATS traded and CCP cleared
             non-triparty repos, as well as on the markets for settlement and custody services in
             relation to fixed income provided by ICSDs and large custodians and for collateral
             management.
   9.3.3.2. The Transaction would lead to the elimination of competition in trading and clearing
             of single stock equity derivatives in which Eurex competes with Euronext
   (809)     As explained in Section 5.1.2.2. above, following the Transaction, the merged entity
             could control clearing for single stock equity derivatives for its own vertically
             integrated offers as well as for those where LCH SA currently provides merchant
             clearing services for Euronext. As a result, DBAG will be in a position to exert
             pricing control over trading/clearing bundles that compete with Eurex' own
             integrated bundles. This may permit DBAG to simultaneously increase the prices
             both of its own bundles and of competing bundles593 ultimately lessening or even
   593
           It is important to understand the competitive difference of this theory of harm to the vertical theory of
           harm addressed in Section 9.3.3.4. below. From an economic perspective, vertical foreclosure arises in a
           situation where an integrated firm with market power increases prices or reduces access/quality for
           rivals in order to divert customers towards its own integrated offering. In mergers which combine both
           vertically and horizontally related assets however (as is the case here), the transaction may substantially
           inhibit horizontal competition albeit no diversion of customers towards the integrated company arises
           (or is even intended).

             completely eliminating competition for the trading/clearing-bundles offered by
             Euronext/LCH.Clearnet. This holds true for a potential wide market for all EEA
             based single stock equity derivatives as well as for several markets based on national
             underlyings only.
   Figure 8: Pre- (left) and post-Transaction           (right) competition   between    DBAG     and
   Euronext/LCH.Clearnet in trading/clearing bundles
   Source: Commission's illustration.
   (810)     The competition between such bundles (or "vertical stacks") is depicted in Figure 8
             above (both for the pre-merger and the post-merger situation). The figure illustrates
             the interaction between DBAG's vertical silo (Eurex) and substitutable bundle
             offerings of Euronext with LCH SA clearing.
   9.3.3.2.1 Notifying Parties' views
   (811)     The Notifying Parties base their main argument on the claim that the relevant market
             includes all European single stock equity derivatives; a market definition based on
             national underlyings would be unduly narrow. They further reject the concept of
             bundle-to-bundle competition but rather focus on direct overlaps on the trading level
             alone. In such a market, the increment resulting from the merger would be limited to
             less than [0-5%] of all EEA trading volumes. In addition, the Notifying Parties
             submit that they will continue to face strong competition from other exchanges
             across Europe, particularly ICE and Euronext.
   (812)     As regards the differentiation between trading and clearing, the Notifying Parties
             submit that these are different markets: The trading of specific single stock
             derivatives should be regarded separately from the market for merchant clearing
             services in which LCH.Clearnet provides services for other trading venues. This
             market would not be affected at all by the Transaction because DBAG does not
             provide this kind of services; hence, there is no overlap. The Notifying Parties
             restrict the competition issues in relation to Euronext to a vertical constellation,
             rather than analysing the horizontal overlaps in the market for bundled services that
             arise from the increasing market power on the clearing level.
   9.3.3.2.1. The Commission's assessment
   (813)     The Commission rejects the Notifying Parties' argument that DBAG's and LSEG's
             clearing services are not in competition with each other merely because DBAG is not
             offering clearing access to third party platforms. While this appears to be technically
             correct from a simplistic view, it masks the fact that final customers may face a
             significant reduction in competition if the merged entity will be able to steer the price
             not only of its own bundles, but also of competing bundles by controlling
             LCH.Clearnet's merchant pricing which is an indispensable component for customers
             who consider trading on a rival's platform such as Euronext. From the perspective of
             final customers, therefore, the merger could lead to a substantial reduction in

            trading and clearing of stock derivatives relating to underlyings from countries where
            LCH.Clearnet provides appreciable merchant clearing services.595
   (818)    These findings are largely supported by the results of the market investigation. In
            particular, numerous respondents show significant concern that the Transaction will
            create a dominant clearing house for derivatives which would control the clearing
            prices of a large proportion of trades. For instance, one respondent notes that the
            Transaction will lead to a "massive increase in market power at the clearing
            level".596
   (819)    Significantly, this increase in market power is not alleviated by the possibility of
            exchanges switching from LCH.Clearnet to other merchant clearing providers. On
            the contrary, it appears that Euronext has no realistic clearing alternative at this stage.
            Indeed, the only other large derivatives clearing house in Europe is ICE Clear, which
            currently follows a closed silo-model similar to DBAG's and hence does not offer
            clearing access for third party trading venues.
   (820)    The fact that Euronext can currently rely on the provision of merchant clearing
            services from LSEG appears to be primarily due to the fact that LSEG is not active in
            competing trading services to any appreciable degree. Other than DBAG and ICE
            (who withhold access), LSEG has an incentive pre-merger to offer access, since
            Euronext is not a competitor. This is likely to change one Eurex and LCH.Clearnet
            belong to the same group.
   (821)    In the following, the Commission first discusses the arguments brought by the
            Notifying Parties in response to the concept of bundle-to-bundle competition in
            general, before assessing the possible anti-competitive behaviour and the potential
            harm to the customers in the three potential markets for single stock equity
            derivatives based on Belgian, French, and Dutch underlyings.
   9.3.3.2.1.1.1. The Notifying Parties' arguments for denying material horizontal effects in
            bundle-to-bundle competition cannot be accepted
   (822)    The Commission rejects the claim that viewing clearing as an input to trading implies
            that a separate merchant clearing market must be defined. From the perspective of
            horizontal competition, it is immaterial whether clearing is viewed as a
            complementary service to trading or whether it is viewed as an input to trading.
            Rather, what matters is whether the Notifying Parties' offerings are in actual
            competition with each (i.e., whether they exert a price constraint on each other).
   (823)    The latter is clearly the case since not even the Notifying Parties deny that traders
            choose between competing bundles of trading and clearing. When DBAG gains
            horizontal control over LCH.Clearnet's clearing, the merged entity will be able to
            exert market power over competing bundles of trade.
   (824)    The Commission further rejects the Notifying Parties' claim that market power along
            the value chain is determined by trading rather than clearing and that one should
            therefore ignore the horizontal overlap in clearing. Rather than being a negligible
            element of a derivatives trade, clearing is a central component of the value
   595
           An equivalent outcome would arise on a potential separate clearing market towards end-customers (i.e.,
           comprising both internal and merchant clearing services).

            proposition in derivatives markets. Since Euronext has no viable alternative other
            than LCH SA, the post-Transaction market power exerted on the clearing level
            implies a significant loss of competition.
   9.3.3.2.1.1.2. The Transaction would lead to price increases
   (825)    The Notifying Parties' arguments with respect to lack of appreciable effects must be
            rejected. The likelihood of a price increase post-Transaction cannot be rejected with
            an argument that LCH.Clearnet would not have an incentive to "support" such anti-
            competitive behaviour. The Notifying Parties merely postulate that these entities
            would "prevent" a price increase without specifying how these platforms should
            achieve this. Euronext has not a single viable clearing alternative to switch to, since
            both Eurex clearing and ICE clearing do not provide clearing services to competitors.
            This venue is therefore locked-in with LCH.Clearnet which would be controlled by
            their competitor DBAG post-Transaction. Moreover, a horizontal effect would not
            only lead to a price increase of Euronext's trading/clearing bundle but would
            similarly permit Eurex to increase the price of its trading/clearing bundle. As a result,
            it must not necessarily be the case that the merged entity would divert customers
            away from Euronext to Eurex (and thereby inflict harm on Euronext). Rather, the
            main competitive injury would be inflicted on customers, who would face higher
            prices both for Euronext's and Eurex's trading/clearing bundles.
   (826)    The Commission further rejects the notion that Euronext possesses sufficient
            countervailing buyer power which allegedly allows it to sponsor entry, integrate
            backwards or otherwise switch its clearing house. As noted before, there is no viable
            alternative merchant clearing house in existence (which is underlined by the
            Notifying Parties' inability to name a credible rival). Nor is the prospect of
            sponsoring entry or backward integration realistic, given the substantial capital
            requirements for such an undertaking.
   (827)    In particular, the alleged real world examples of "switching" via integration are
            highly misleading. Concretely, the Notifying Parties give the example of Liffe and
            LME "switching away" from LCH.Clearnet.597 However, the case of Liffe concerned
            the merger of two trading venues, where one of them (ICE) already had an internal
            clearing house. Obviously, also Euronext could overcome its concerns of clearing
            reliance on the merged entity by merging with the merged entity. However, if
            anything, this would only further exacerbate the anticompetitive effect of the merger
            rather than remedying it. The reality is that there simply exists no independent
            merchant clearing house in the market which Euronext could merge with.
   (828)    Similarly, the example of LME developing its own in-house clearing underlines,
            rather than contradicts the Commission's analysis. Indeed, the clearing house
            required substantial capital investment and at least three years to get from the
            planning phase to the operation.
   (829)    Finally, the Notifying Parties' argument wrongly assumes that horizontal effects must
            necessarily harm Euronext. As explained above, the main result of anticompetitive
            horizontal effect is that both Eurex and Euronext bundles of trading and clearing
            become more expensive, since the merged entity will be able to raise both the
            merchant clearing price and the clearing component of its own integrated

           trading/clearing services. Such a price increase across the board can easily be
           orchestrated in such a way that no diversion of customers away from Euronext takes
           place. As a result, even if Euronext had any countervailing power (which the
           Commission denies), the Notifying Parties could easily implement any price increase
           in such a way that Euronext and similar platforms are not harmed, while the damage
           accrues to consumers.
   (830)   The argument that users (traders) could prevent a price increase or switch to another
           trading and clearing bundle is also not convincing. As noted in Section 5.3.3. above,
           customers have no viable ability to stop LCH.Clearnet from raising prices. Neither
           LCH.Clearnet's governance structure nor LCH.Clearnet's FRAND undertaking are
           sufficient to stop any possible price increase resulting from the likely loss of
           competition.
   (831)   Moreover, even if banks had the ability to stop a price increase (quod non), they
           would nonetheless lack the incentive to do so. After all, platform price increases
           would predominantly harm final customers due to pass-through, while banks
           themselves could easily be compensated by the Notifying Parties through rebates if
           there was any necessity for this (which the Commission denies in any event).
   (832)   Moreover, even in the unrealistic scenario where users could prevent a price increase
           by LCH.Clearnet, note that horizontal effects go in both directions: they not only
           increase the first merging party's incentive to raise prices, but also the second party's.
           In the case discussed here, the Notifying Parties focus all of their arguments on
           LCH.Clearnet's alleged lack of pricing power. Even if this was correct (which is
           denied), it would not stop Eurex from raising prices post-Transaction. Specifically,
           note that the concentration will give Eurex substantial incentives to raise prices.
           Concretely, any potential diversion away of customers from Eurex would be softened
           by the fact that LCH.Clearnet would benefit from such diversion and would be part
           of the same group post-Transaction.
   (833)   The horizontal competition concerns are further aggravated by the fact that Euronext
           and Eurex are close competitors in the relevant markets. Both venues are pan-
           European players, focus on the same investor groups and have closely comparable
           pricing schemes. This is also perceived by market participants replying that when
           comparing fees for Eurex and Euronext they see "No difference"598 or find them to be
           "roughly in line"599. Others state that "We believe they are roughly the same,
           structured in a similar way"600.
   (834)   The fact that Eurex and Euronext are in fact close competitors can also supported by
           further results of the market investigation. A large European bank states that "Single
           stock futures and options on a variety of European issuers are available on both
           Eurex and Euronext."601 That both venues are competing on "Equity derivatives" in

             general can also be deducted from several other respondents.602 The closeness of
             competition can be further deducted from other large European banks that either see
             "no major differences" between both venues603 or explain that differences are "very
             case-by-case dependent (or contract-by-contract). Contract A might be more liquid
             on EUREX while contract B might be overall more attractive".604
   (835)     Further answers given by the market participants lead to the same conclusion that
             both venues are closely competing with each other: When asked which market
             participants would consider for trades currently executed on Euronext, all
             respondents that would see an alternative at all mentioned Eurex.605
   (836)     Finally, the closeness of competition between Eurex and Euronext is also claimed by
             the Notifying Parties themselves, stating that "Eurex's closest competitors are other
             mainstream competitors like ICE and Euronext offering convenient trading to
             international customers across a broad range of underlying nationalities."606 This
             finding is also in line with the Commission's prior assessment in DBAG / NYSE
             Euronext.607
   (837)     In light of these findings, the Commission concludes that Eurex and Euronext are
             close competitors in the potential market for single stock equity derivatives based on
             Belgian, French, and Dutch underlyings and that the merged entity will be in a
             position to control pricing of both of them.
   9.3.3.2.1.1.3. Conclusion
   (838)     In light of the above, the Commission considers that the Transaction will lead to a
             significant impediment of effective competition in a potential market for single stock
             equity derivatives based on Dutch, French, and Belgium underlyings as it would
             eliminate competition for combined trading and clearing of exchange traded
             derivatives in a number of underlyings where Eurex competes with Euronext relying
             on merchant clearing services from LCH.Clearnet SA.
   9.3.3.2.1.2. Assessment on a wider market comprising all EEA single stock derivatives
   (839)     As can be seen from the market share table provided below, DBAG is the leading
             exchange in the potential wider market of all EEA based single stock equity
             derivatives. By comparison, the direct increment from the merger is relatively small
             with less than [0-5%] and mainly originates from IDEM, LSEG's Italian derivatives
             market. The increment originating from LSE DM is even smaller with only [0-5%]
             and mainly based on activities in small niche markets.

            stock equity derivatives, irrespective of whether the market comprises all European
            stock equity derivatives or is further subdivided.608 In this decision, the Commission
            also identified differences between incumbent exchanges and pan-European
            providers.609 In spite of relevant developments like the spin-off of Euronext after the
            ICE / NYSE Euronext merger this general market structure still holds true.
   (843)    In the market definition, it was left open whether the relevant market should be
            subdivided into options and futures or actually includes both instruments. When
            analysing a potential market for EEA based single stock equity derivatives, issues
            particularly arise in the options segment where Euronext has shares of over [10-20%]
            which has to be seen in addition to the direct market shares of the Notifying Parties’
            amounting to [50-60%] ([50-60%] from Eurex plus [0-5%] direct LSEG increment).
            In this particular segment, ICE accounts for only [5-10%]. The remaining market
            shares are distributed among mostly locally focussed exchanges (including Nasdaq
            OMX with its core activities in Scandinavia). The only remaining truly pan-
            European player would be significantly smaller than the merged entity and would not
            be in a position to fully replicate the competitive pressure currently exercised by
            Euronext on Eurex. In a potential market for EEA based single stock futures, ICE is
            stronger with a share of almost [20-30%]. Nevertheless, it would still be the only
            credible pan-European alternative to the Notifying Parties that combine almost [60-
            70%] of the market.
   (844)    In light if the above, the Commission considers that the Transaction leads to a
            significant impediment of effective competition even under a wide market definition,
            including single stock equity derivatives of any EEA underlying because of the
            bundle-to-bundle competition in which the merged entity will also control clearing
            for products traded on Euronext through its control of LCH SA.
   9.3.3.3. The Transaction would lead to the foreclosure of Euronext in relation to single stock
            equity derivatives
   (845)    The fact that DBAG competes head-to-head with Euronext for trading and clearing
            of single stock equity derivatives holds true for a wide market comprising all EEA
            underlyings as well as a number of smaller markets, including only contracts based
            on specific national underlyings. The dependency of Euronext on clearing via LCH
            SA is also independent of this specific market definition.
   (846)    Therefore, and in addition to the horizontal concerns already discussed above, the
            Transaction would also lead to vertical concerns originating from the same structural
            link between Euronext and LCH SA but having different effects on competition..
            This dependency needs to be analysed in further detail.
   9.3.3.3.1.      Notifying Parties' view
   (847)    According to the Notifying Parties, the bundle-to-bundle competition should be
            assessed only as a vertical relationship. However even from this perspective, the
            Notifying Parties submit that the combination of DBAG's and LSEG's clearing
            houses would not give rise to any vertical foreclosure concerns for the following
            reasons.

   (848)    First, in the Form CO, in their response to the Decision opening the proceedings, and
            the response to the SO, the Notifying Parties argue that LCH.Clearnet's governance
            structure, including open access and FRAND commitments as well as the individual
            customer clearing arrangements would prevent such foreclosure. In addition, the
            Notifying Parties argue that customers exercise significant countervailing buyer
            power through a treat to switch to alternative CCPs, sponsoring entry or expansion or
            moving to a self-supply model.
   (849)    Second, the Notifying Parties argue that open access requirements introduced by
            MiFID II/MiFIR would prevent such foreclosure. According to the Notifying Parties,
            these access requirements would force their clearing houses to offer clearing access
            to third party trading venues and therefore solve any concerns relating from the
            exclusivity of the connection between Euronext and LCH SA.
   (850)    Finally, the Notifying Parties argue that the merged entity would lack the incentive to
            pursue any foreclosure strategy as going against the open access model of
            LCH.Clearnet would have negative impact on LCH.Clearnet's commercial reputation
            and would likely result in retaliation from the large customers.
   9.3.3.3.2.      The Commission's assessment
   (851)    The Commission considers that the merged entity will have an incentive to leverage
            its market power at clearing level by fully or partially foreclosing Euronext that relies
            on LCH SA's clearing services to eliminate competition at trading level.
   (852)    Both trading and clearing are characterised by substantial economies of scale (on the
            supply-side) and network effects (on the demand-side). Successful operation requires
            providers to maintain an efficient scale to be attractive to traders and to be able to
            spread their fixed costs over a sufficiently large base of trades. Against this
            background, a foreclosure strategy can be undertaken through price (for example
            margin squeeze) and non-price measures (for example degrading access).
   (853)    A foreclosure strategy that aims at increasing the price of bundled products
            (including the clearing component from LCH SA) offered by DBAG's competitors
            and/or reducing the quality of these services may seriously damage their competitive
            capabilities to the benefit of DBAG. This is because customers facing price increases
            by DBAG's competitors will likely shift the liquidity away from these platforms,
            which will further increase the costs of these platforms.
   (854)    Such a strategy would have (at least) two significant economic benefits for the
            merged entity.
   (855)    First, raising rivals' cost is likely to enhance DBAG's own pricing power at both
            trading and clearing levels and thus extract surplus along the value chain.
   (856)    Second, partial or full foreclosure of Euronext would also fortify the significant
            market power that the Notifying Parties already possess in the respective parts of the
            complementary services. As a result of such foreclosure, entry by potential
            competitors may be deterred even more than pre-merger. In particular, after the
            exclusion of competitors from the trading market, competitive entry against the
            merged entity would be considerably more difficult if the potential entrant has to
            enter on all levels of the supply chain. In particular, this precludes the ability of an
            entrant to first penetrate one layer (for example trading) and then expand its product
            offering to other layers of the vertical stack subsequently. A successful foreclosure
            strategy would therefore not only increase the Notifying Parties' immediate market
EN                                                 163                                                EN

          power over bundles of trading and clearing, but would additionally increase the
          difficulty of challenging its position in the future at individual layers of the value
          chain.
   (857)  The concerns described above are supported by the results of the market
          investigation. In particular, various respondents see a concrete danger that the
          merged entity might engage in price and/or non-price foreclosure at the trading level
          to the detriment of Euronext. For instance, one market participant argues that "The
          merged entity will also inherit DBAG's dominant position in the trading and clearing
          of listed equity derivatives (with a 75% post-merger share), which will be
          strengthened by the fact that its largest competitor at the trading level, Euronext,
          clears through LSE (LCH.Clearnet Paris), creating a real risk of vertical foreclosure
          at the trading level."610 In this respect, Euronext itself explains that: "Unlike DBAG
          and LSEG, Euronext does not own or control its own CCP. Instead, it relies on
          LCH.Clearnet’s clearing services. This situation is acceptable today because there is
          no material competition at the trading level between LSE, which controls
          LCH.Clearnet, and Euronext. Following the merger of DBAG and LSEG,
          LCH.Clearnet would be owned and controlled by DBAG, Euronext’s leading
          Eurozone competitor in listed derivatives. This could have serious implications for
          Euronext, in particular in derivatives, where trading and clearing are closely
          integrated."611
   (858)  Partial ownership does not typically reduce the incentive to foreclose. On the
          contrary, the merged entity's partial ownership of LCH.Clearnet only means that
          there is an even larger incentive to divert customers to Eurex. After all, the merged
          entity would earn the entirety of Eurex's silo profits, whereas any profits of
          LCH.Clearnet must be shared with a number of minority shareholders. The Notifying
          Parties should therefore have an economic preference to divert customers away from
          LCH.Clearnet towards the DBAG silo.
   (859)  One market participant has voiced concerns that the Notifying Parties engage already
          today in exclusionary practices by bundling trades that have to be cleared on their
          CCPs (trades executed on DBAG, Borsa Italiana and LSE's International Order
          Book) and trades that are on the contestable clearing market. The market participant
          indicates that LCH SA and LCH Ltd already engage in such practices which would
          be even more detrimental post-Transaction, as the merged entity would have access
          to an even larger pool of "protected" trades.612 These techniques are directly
          replicable in the context of the markets for single stock equity derivatives.
   (860)  The ability to foreclose is further supported by the fact that LCH SA is the only
          clearing house offering large-scale merchant clearing services in Europe. All other
          clearing houses, except for some niche players focusing on equities, operate vertical
          silos. It is unlikely that post-Transaction, and at least until the open access provisions
          kick-in, these players would open their vertical silos. If anything, with the merger,
          the incentives to continue operating vertical silo structures defending the own
          strongholds will even increase.

   (861)    The Notifying Parties claim that Euronext could change CCPs with the support of
            LCH.Clearnet, if it would become unsatisfied with the service. This should enable
            that "Euronext is able to switch to an alternative provider without disruptions to its
            services".613 Euronext, however, perceives this option more skeptically stating: "Any
            scenario in which Euronext is forced to switch from LCH.Clearnet SA to another
            CCP remains technically complex, operationally risky and expensive. In addition,
            there is no guarantee that current Euronext customers would be willing to invest
            time, effort and money in changing CCPs, not least when they are already connected
            to other markets that have clearing structures able to deliver their needs at a lower
            cost for any transition of volume. The frictional costs of switching flow from
            Euronext to another exchange with suitable clearing is likely less than the costs
            members would face if Euronext introduced a new CCP."614
   (862)    It follows that the threat to switch to alternative merchant clearing providers would
            not be credible so as to discipline the merged entity and prevent any foreclosure
            strategy.
   9.3.3.3.2.1.    LCH.Clearnet's governance structure is insufficient to prevent foreclosure
   (863)    The Parties’ claim that LCH.Clearnet’s governance structure prevents any attempt to
            foreclose Euronext does not hold in light of the evidence.
   (864)    LCH.Clearnet has incorporated in its "Core Operating Principles", that services
            should be offered on fair, reasonable, open, and non-discriminatory" ("FRAND")
            terms.615 However, these cannot, in itself, be expected to defeat a foreclosure
            strategy. FRAND commitments generally consist of two parts: (i) a non-
            discrimination part and (ii) a commitment to "reasonable" price levels.
   (865)    As regards non-discrimination, a price-based foreclosure strategy does not require
            that externally provided services are priced higher than internal service charges.
            Indeed, internal charges are merely transfer prices within a company and can
            therefore be adjusted to whichever external fee is necessary to engage in foreclosure.
   (866)    As regards defining a reasonable price standard this may prove difficult in the
            absence of clear industry benchmarks. Indeed, LCH.Clearnet is currently a quasi-
            monopolist for merchant clearing services of appreciable volumes of trades. There is
            therefore no competitive benchmark price for external clearing services. It is not
            clear that a functional external comparator exists that would enable a "fair" level of
            access charges to be determined for the purposes of a FRAND assessment. What
            constitutes a "fair" access price risks therefore to be largely arbitrary in these specific
            circumstances. Certainly, it should be expected that sellers and buyers would have
            largely different opinions about what is "fair" and "reasonable". The large number of
            actual disputes over FRAND royalties across the globe is evidence to this. It is not
            clear, therefore, that the existence of a FRAND commitment, on its own, could
            constitute a meaningful barrier to foreclosure.

   (867)     The Notifying Parties submission that the Commission accepted commitments based
             on FRAND terms in other cases616 is misleading in this context. Behavioural
             commitments imposed by the Commission in other cases cannot be compared to
             purely commercial arrangements that could be changed at any time in the future. In
             addition, it has to be taken into account that the identified issue is structural in nature
             and that the Commissions guidelines are clear that in these types of situations,
             structural remedies are, as a rule, preferable.617
   (868)     In this context the Commission also notes that the Notifying Parties misrepresent the
             OFT decision by stating that the decision "supports the argument that
             LCH.Clearnet's governance arrangements militate against any foreclosure
             strategy."618 Indeed, this is at odds with the OFT conclusion that "even taking
             account of the corporate governance provisions and regulatory framework, the
             parties would be likely to retain the ability to engage in partial foreclosure strategies
             (namely a uniform price rise and/or quality degradation)".619 The only strategies
             OFT concluded that may be limited by the governance structure in place would relate
             to the ability to engage in total foreclosure through refusal of access/supply.620

   (873)     This episode clearly shows that the obligation to accept new products for clearing –
             even for reasonable clearing fees – is not sufficient to shield third party venues
             relying on merchant clearing by LCH.Clearnet. Indeed, [BUSINESS SECRETS] are
             a very practical example of how LCH.Clearnet has an ability to obstruct Euronext's
             success on the market.
   (874)     The Notifying Parties' claim that LCH.Clearnet is obliged to exercise its best efforts
             to support the introduction of new products as well as the claim regarding the
             influence of the Derivatives Steering Committee can also be reviewed in light of the
             incident described by Euronext.
   (875)     In fact, Euronext did complain [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ABOUT
             TIMING AND COMPETITIVENESS OF CLEARING ARRANGEMENTS FOR
             SPECIFIC PRODUCTS]627 – shows significant ability for a partial foreclosure.
             Such a delay has to be seen in the context of the competitive structures in the
             relevant markets where a clear first mover advantage exists; given the strong network
             effects typical for these markets, every late comer will face additional difficulties to
             attract liquidity for a new type of product.
   (876)     Based on the above, the Commission concludes that Euronext’s specific
             arrangements with LCH.Clearnet are insufficient to prevent at least partial
             foreclosure strategies.
   9.3.3.3.2.3.     MiFID II/MIFIR would not fully prevent foreclosure of trading venues
   (877)     The Commission acknowledges that MiFID II and MiFIR are important steps in
             further promoting competition between exchanges. However, the new rules are not
             designed to remedy specific foreclosure concerns stemming from the proposed
             Transaction.
   (878)     First, the full implementation of the open access provisions will take place after the
             proposed closing of the Transaction and might be effectively delayed in practice until
             2020 in some member states.628
   (879)     Second, competition at trading level brought about by opening access to trading
             venues to the merged entity's CCPs could be hampered if the merged entity would
             charge very low or no trading fee to evict competitors at trading level and recoup the
             loss of trading revenue by charging a higher clearing fee. Open access obligations do
             not prescribe the level of fees for (non-discriminatory) access, and thereby exchanges
             can react by raising the clearing fee and decrease the trading fee. While for their own
             users such a change in the fee structure would be neutral, a high clearing fee would
             be uneconomical for any trading venue that wants to access a CCP. In addition, given
             that the merged entity will enjoy significant market power at clearing level, charging
           CCPs to at least compete to some extent and over the long term on margin requirements. Credit
           Agricole stated in reply to this question: "Exchanges compete in all areas including margin
           requirements and it is difficult to dissociate one criteria from the rest of the product offer". This
           perception is also shared by Euronext, stating that "Margin requirements are the largest determining
           factor for a member in choosing a trading venue" (Euronext post-meeting RFI response, page 6 [ID
           3309]).

             high clearing fees is possible as it would not necessarily be defeated by a loss of
             demand. The Commission notes that such a higher clearing fee needs not to be
             discriminatory and may be applied across the board for all trading venues, including
             those of the merged entity. As a result, such a strategy would at worst have a neutral
             effect on the revenues of the merged entity and at best be profitable.629
   (880)     As concerns access to CCPs other than those of the Notifying Parties under the
             upcoming access regime, the Commission notes that the Parties will be able to
             implement (partial) foreclosure strategies even before full applicability of the new
             rules. The anti-competitive effects of the merger would have already materialized
             and customers would have already diverted to the merged entity by then. Given the
             network nature of the industry, liquidity would have become even stickier to the
             merged entity and barriers to expansion for the other players thus higher.
   9.3.3.4. Conclusion
   (881)     In view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the Transaction would lead
             to a significant impediment of effective competition in the market for single stock
             equity derivatives, regardless of the precise market definition as the Transaction
             would eliminate the horizontal bundle-to-bundle competition between Eurex and
             Euronext.
   (882)     In addition, the Commission also considers that the Transaction would lead to a
             significant impediment of effective competition as it would foreclose Euronext (fully
             or partially) relying on clearing services provided by LCH SA.
   10.       PROVISION OF INTEGRATED CLEARING SERVICES
   10.1.     Notifying Parties' activities
   (883)     DBAG and LSEG are active in the provision of clearing services in relation to a
             variety of financial instruments.
   (884)     DBAG provides clearing services with respect to equities and equities-like products,
             bonds, repos, and for exchange traded derivatives through Eurex Clearing, which
             acts as CCP for the Eurex Exchange, Eurex Bonds, Eurex Repo, FWB, and the Irish
             Stock Exchange. Within Eurex, Eurex OTC Clear service offers central clearing of
             OTC interest rate swaps and a number of other OTC derivatives such as vanilla
             interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, overnight index swaps, and single
             currency basis swaps.
   (885)     DBAG also operates "ECC", a commodity derivatives clearing house, wholly-owned
             by EEX, which provides clearing services for a range of energy products, including
             physical and financial trading of power, freight, natural gas and emissions derivatives
             traded on EEX or on third party trading venues linked to ECC.630
   (886)     LSEG offers clearing services for equities, equities-like products, exchange traded
             derivatives, bonds, and repos through LCH.Clearnet Group which it acquired in 2013
             and Italian clearing house CC&G clearing instruments traded on LSEG's subsidiary,

   (887)   The LCH.Clearnet comprises two separate CCPs in Europe: LCH.Clearnet SA,
           located in Paris and LCH.Clearnet Ltd located in London. [BUSINESS SECRETS].
   (888)   LCH.Clearnet Ltd runs separate business units for its diverse product lines
           (SwapClear, RepoClear, EquityClear, etc.). The spider tool enables cross-margining
           across [BUSINESS SECRETS] but not the [POOLS] operated by LCH.Clearnet SA.
           SwapClear is by far the largest single pool of LCH.Clearnet, accounting for over
           80% of the total open interest held by LCH.Clearnet Ltd.
   (889)   LCH.Clearnet offers merchant clearing services to several trading venues across a
           variety of financial instruments including Euronext, Nasdaq's NLX, BrokerTec,
           BATS, Oslo Børs etc.
   (890)   With respect to commodities, LSEG offers clearing services for Italian and German
           power derivatives through CC&G. CC&G only clears power derivative contracts
           traded or registered on IDEX631. LCH Ltd is active provides merchant clearing for a
           number of commodities including freight derivatives traded via Baltex, CLTX, FIS,
           SSYm Clarksons, GFI and ICAP.
   10.2.   Market definition
   10.2.1. The Commission's preliminary view in the Statement of Objections
   (891)   In the Statement of Objections, the Commission preliminarily considered that it is
           appropriate, in addition to an analysis by type of financial instrument, to also to
           conduct an assessment along the financial services value chain.
   (892)   In the Statement of Objections, the Commission expressed the view that this position
           appeared to be supported by the evidence gathered by the Commission during its
           market investigation, and that the evidence on the file, including Parties' internal
           documents indicated that there is increasing demand – and supply – of integrated
           clearing services, defined as an offering for customers to clear several types of
           financial instruments or asset classes in a single CCP.
   (893)   The Commission preliminarily considered that this separate market existed for the
           following reasons:
   (894)   First, the demand for integrated clearing solutions can be distinguished from the
           demand for individual products.
   (895)   It is driven by capital savings that can be achieved by customers pooling their
           demand for clearing services across instruments in one place. These savings may be
           collateral savings, default fund contributions savings, savings from operational
           efficiency and reduced connections etc. These saving are generally of such a
           magnitude that the supply of such integrated clearing services is not substitutable
           from customers' point of view. As a result, customers seeking joint clearing solutions
           will generally not be satisfied with the supply of individual components. Rather than
           switching to suppliers of individual components and selecting those on the basis of
           price and non-price parameters, customers will look for another supplier of
           integrated clearing solutions (to the extent that such solutions are available). In other
   631
          IDEX is the energy commodity derivatives segment of the Italian Derivatives Market (“IDEM”), the
          derivatives trading platform of Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (“Borsa Italiana”).
EN                                                      169                                                EN

         words, customers will compare the integrated solutions of various suppliers rather
         than the sum of individual services.
   (896) Second, collateral savings and regulatory capital requirements drive demand for
         integrated clearing services.
   (897) There is an increasing importance of CCP clearing and a related demand for
         efficiencies as regards collateral and regulatory capital requirements. Many
         customers, in particular sell-side customers, trade and clear a variety of different
         financial instruments and consider that clearing differing types of transactions in the
         same CCP brings significant benefits. In view of these drivers in the market a new
         demand for integrated clearing services that encompass clearing of different types of
         financial instruments has started to emerge.
   (898) Financial market infrastructure providers are seeking to maximise complementarities
         across clearing services which make it increasingly desirable for large customers to
         concentrate as much of their diverse clearing needs in one place as possible in order
         to derive savings from integrated clearing services.
   (899) Third, large clearing houses have begun to supply integrated clearing services in
         response to this new demand
   (900) In response to the changing demand, providers of clearing services have begun to
         enhance the attractiveness of their services by offering clearing of complementary
         products, for example by providing the possibility of cross-margining of correlated
         positions in a customers' overall portfolio, or to exploit other synergies deriving from
         clearing (or even trading) of financial instruments under one roof, all in order to
         reduce their customers' capital costs (for example through a reduction of the initial
         margin, of default fund contributions etc.).
   (901) The Commission considered in the Statement of Objections that as a response to the
         regulation driven demand for integrated clearing services, large clearing houses have
         recognised that they need to supply such services in order to remain competitive. The
         foregoing also has important implications as to the actors on the market for
         integrated clearing services: Given the importance of cross-asset clearing, supply of
         these services can only come from clearing houses offering the clearing of a
         sufficiently large number of different instruments and assets.
   (902) Fourth, the Commission considered that clearing of OTC and exchange traded
         interest rate derivatives are but one example of integrated clearing services being
         provided as a response to a distinct demand, and that there there is a variety of
         different combinations of integrated clearing services. Indeed, there are strong
         indications that there is demand, and as a result, competition, for even broader
         integrated clearing services, in essence for the same reason that drove the
         development of cross-margining tools for IR swaps and futures: The pressing need of
         large customers to save collateral, capital and reduce the leverage ratio.
   (903) In view of the above, the Commission considered in the Statement of Objections that
         there are strong indications of the existence not only of distinct demand for
         integrated clearing services, but also of distinct supply of such integrated clearing
         services.
   (904) The Commission left open the question of whether the geographic scope of the
         market for integrated clearing services is worldwide or limited to the EEA.

   (905)   Against the background of this market definition, the Commission preliminarily
           concluded in the Statement of Objections that, in view of the exceptionally diverse
           offering of clearing services that the Notifying Parties are able to provide as
           compared to their rivals, the closeness of competition between them, the reduction of
           competitors from four to three, the merger between two important innovators and the
           resulting likely loss of innovation competition, and the lack of likely entry, the
           Transaction would lead to a significant impediment of effective competition in the
           market for integrated clearing services.
   10.2.2. Notifying Parties' views
   (906)   In response to the Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties first argue that the
           hypothetical market for integrated clearing services does not exist, and that a
           definition of an integrated clearing services market is inconsistent with the market
           definition adopted for ETDs and OTC IRDs.
   (907)   In addition, the Notifying Parties argue that the Commission's theory in relation to
           integrated clearing services relies heavily on the availability and competitive
           significance of cross-margining between ETDs and OTC IRDs, [BUSINESS
           SECRETS].
   (908)   Moreover, the Notifying Parties argued that there is no general trend towards
           customers wanting to consolidate their clearing activities in a single CCP, as
           arguably demonstrated by the fact that market shares of large CCPs are not
           increasing across asset classes, and that the CCP landscape remains fragmented.
   (909)   Finally, the Notifying Parties argued that the Statement of Objections has ignored the
           significance of the Parties’ European and global competitors in this regard, and in
           particular also as regards innovation. The Notifying Parties submit that all of them
           will continue to innovate post-Transaction. Indeed CME (now benefitting from
           equivalence at both trading and clearing levels in the EEA) was the first to launch
           cross-margining between ET and OTC IRDs, ahead of either of the Parties. Post-
           Transaction, the Parties’ competitors will be just as well-placed to continue
           innovating to win business and maintain their competitive constraint.
   10.2.3. The Commission's assessment
   (910)   The Commission has carefully considered the Notifying Parties' arguments and the
           evidence presented in their response to the Statement of Objections.632
   (911)   However, the questions of whether a separate market for integrated clearing services
           exists and of whether the Transaction gives rise to a significant impediment of
           effective competition in such possible market can be left open for the purposes of
           this Decision, as the overall assessment of the case would not change. This is
           because, as explained in Section 11, the remedies submitted by the Notifying Parties
           are insufficient to solve competition concerns in the markets for CCP clearing of
           bonds, for ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos, ATS traded and CCP cleared
           non-triparty repos, as well as on the markets for settlement and custody services in
           relation to fixed income provided by ICSDs and large custodians and for collateral
           management.

   11.     COMMITMENTS
   11.1.   Analytical framework for the assessment of the Commitments
   (912)   Where the Commission finds that a concentration raises competition concerns in that
           it could significantly impede effective competition, the parties may seek to modify
           the concentration in order to resolve the competition concerns and thereby gain
           clearance of their merger.633
   (913)   Under the Merger Regulation, it is the responsibility of the Commission to show that
           a concentration would significantly impede effective competition. The Commission
           then communicates its competition concerns to the parties to allow them to formulate
           appropriate and corresponding proposals for remedies. It is then for the parties to the
           concentration to put forward commitments.634 The Commission only has power to
           accept commitments that are deemed capable of rendering the concentration
           compatible with the internal market as they will prevent a significant impediment of
           effective competition in all relevant markets where competition concerns were
           identified.635 To this end, the commitments have to eliminate the competition
           concerns entirely and have to be comprehensive and effective from all points of
           view.636 The commitments must also be proportionate to the competition concerns
           identified.637
   (914)   In assessing whether proposed commitments will likely eliminate the competition
           concerns identified, the Commission considers all relevant factors including inter
           alia the type, scale and scope of the proposed commitments, judged by reference to
           the structure and particular characteristics of the market in which the competition
           concerns arise, including the position of the parties and other participants on the
           market.638
   (915)   In order for the commitments to comply with those principles, commitments must be
           capable of being implemented effectively within a short period of time.639 Where,
           however, the parties submit proposals for remedies that are so extensive and complex
           that is not possible for the Commission to determine with the requisite degree of
           certainty, at the time of its decision, that they will be fully implemented and that they
           are likely to maintain effective competition in the market, an authorisation decision
           cannot be granted.640

         exceed the limits of what is appropriate and necessary in order to attain the objectives pursued; when
         there is a choice between several appropriate measures recourse must be had to the least onerous, and
         the disadvantages caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued" (T-177/04 easyJet v

   (916)   The Merger Regulation leaves discretion to the Commission as regards the form
           which acceptable commitments take as long as the commitments meet the requisite
           standard.641
   (917)   Structural commitments will meet the applicable conditions only in so far as the
           Commission is able to conclude with the requisite degree of certainty that it will be
           possible to implement them and that it is likely that the new commercial structures
           resulting from them will be sufficiently workable, viable and lasting to ensure that
           the significant impediment to effective competition will not materialise.642
   (918)   While divestiture commitments are generally the best way to eliminate competition
           concerns resulting from horizontal overlaps, other structural commitments, such as
           access remedies, may be suitable to resolve concerns if those remedies are equivalent
           to divestitures in their effects.643 Commitments relating to the future behaviour of the
           merged entity may be acceptable only exceptionally in very specific
           circumstances.644
   (919)   When assessing the remedies proposed by the parties, the Commission has the duty
           to ensure that the remedies would be effective in practice. In order for the
           commitments to remove the competition concerns entirely and be comprehensive and
           effective, there has to be an effective implementation and ability to monitor the
           commitments.645 Whereas divestitures once implemented do not require any further
           monitoring measures, other types of commitments require effective monitoring
           mechanisms in order to ensure that their effect is not reduced or even eliminated by
           the parties. Otherwise such commitments would have to be considered as mere
           declarations of intentions by the parties and would not amount to binding conditions
           and obligations, as, due to the lack of effective monitoring mechanisms, it is unlikely
           that the Commission would be able to detect any breach and, if necessary, to revoke
           the decision according to Article 8(6)(b) of the Merger Regulation or to impose fines
           as per Article 14(2)(d) of the Merger Regulation.
   (920)   As for divestitures, the divested activities must consist of a viable business that can
           compete with the merged entity on a lasting basis. To ensure the viability of the
           business, it may also be necessary to include activities which are related to markets
           where the Commission did not identify competition concerns.646
   (921)   In terms of timing, pursuant to Article 19(2) of the Commission Regulation (EC) No
           802/2004,647 the commitments must be submitted in a timely fashion, that is no later
           than 65 working days after proceedings were initiated, to allow for an adequate
   641
         See Case T-177/04 easyJet v Commission [2006] ECR II-1913, paragraph 197: "Article 6(2) of
         Regulation No 4064/89 provides that the Commission may authorise a merger if the commitments
         proposed by the parties dispel the serious doubts as to the compatibility of the merger with the common
         market. Regulation No 4064/89 thus lays down the objective to be achieved by the Commission, but
         leaves it a wide discretion as to the form which the commitments in question may take."

          assessment and for proper consultation of Member States.648 The Commission is
          under no obligation to accept any potential improvements to the commitments after
          the expiry of that deadline.649 If the Commission nevertheless voluntarily agrees to
          assess such commitments, they will only be accepted where it can clearly be
          determined – on the basis of the Commission's assessment of information already
          received in the course of the investigation, including the results of prior market
          testing, and without the need for any other market test – that such commitments,
          once implemented, fully and unambiguously resolve the competition concerns
          identified and where there is sufficient time for proper consultation with Member
          States. The Commission will normally reject modified commitments which do not
          fulfil those conditions.650
   (922)  It is against these principles that the Commission assessed the viability, the
          effectiveness, and the ability of the proposed commitments to entirely eliminate the
          competition concerns identified in Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this Decision.
   (923)  The Commission's conclusions with respect to the suitability of the submitted
          commitments are based on all available evidence, including the results of the market
          test and its own analysis against the criteria for acceptable remedies in merger cases
          contained in the Remedies Notice.
   11.2.  The various sets of commitments submitted by the Notifying Parties
   (924)  In the area of fixed income clearing the Transaction gives rise to a strengthening of a
          dominant position on three distinct markets (the market for CCP clearing of bonds,
          and the markets for ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos and non–triparty
          repos). The overall dominant position of the merged entity in these markets also has
          a knock-on effect on the market for settlement and custody provided by ICSDs and
          global custodians in relation to fixed income and the market for collateral
          management where it may lead to a foreclosure of competitors, and in particular
          Clearstream's main competitor, Euroclear which depends on inputs from CCPs, i.e.
          clearing fixed income trades.
   (925)  LCH SA has a significantly larger presence than DBAG (Eurex) in clearing of ATS
          traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos and in CCP clearing of bonds, and clears €
          GC Plus, LSEG's triparty repo product.
   (926)  In order to address the competition concerns identified in the Statement of
          Objections, and maintained following the Notifying Parties' response to the
          Statement of Objections, the Notifying Parties formally submitted commitments on 6
          February 2017. Modified versions of those commitments were submitted on 8 and 9
          February 2017 ("First Commitments").
   (927)  In essence, the First Commitments concerned a binding agreement that LSEG had
          entered into with Euronext N.V. ("Euronext" or the "Purchaser") on 3 January 2017
          for the sale of LCH SA, completion of the agreement being conditional on the
          Transaction being approved by the Commission in accordance with the Merger
          Regulation.

   (928)   The First Commitments aimed at removing the significant impediments to effective
           competition discussed in Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9, namely on the markets for:
                  –       CCP clearing of bonds;
                  –       ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos;
                  –       ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos;
                  –       settlement and custody services in relation to fixed income provided by
                          ICSDs and large custodians;
                  –       collateral management; and
                  –       single stock equity derivatives.
   (929)   On 9 February 2017, the Commission launched a market test of the First
           Commitments (referred to as the "Market Test"). The deadline for market
           participants to provide feedback was 14 February 2017.651
   (930)   On 16 February 2017, the Commission informed the Notifying Parties of the results
           of the Market Test during a state of play call. Further conference calls between the
           Notifying Parties and the Commission took place on 17 and 18 February 2017.
   (931)   To allow the Notifying Parties to verify the Commission's statements, the
           Commission granted them access to non-confidential responses to the Market Test
           within the framework of the access to the file procedure, in the morning of 17
           February 2017. The last response from Euronext was sent to the Notifying Parties on
           18 February 2017 shortly after the non-confidential version of Euronext's reply
           became available.
   (932)   On 17 February 2017, the Notifying Parties orally hinted at the idea of an alternative
           remedy ("alternative remedy proposal").
   (933)   On the same day and in subsequent exchanges on 18 and 19 February 2017 the
           Commission indicated that the informal proposal seemed to fall short of the legal
           standard for acceptance of late remedies652 and indicated that a clear-cut solution at
           this stage which would not necessitate a further market test could be the divestiture
           of LSEG's MTS.
   (934)   During those conversations, LSEG explained that [FOLLOWING DIALOGUE

         reflected in the draft revised Commitments and can thus not be enforced by the Commission, should it

   11.2.1.1. Description of the First Commitments
   (938)     The First Commitments provided for a full divestiture of all shares in LCH SA, a
             Eurozone-based clearing house and central counterparty (CCP) to Euronext.
   (939)     LCH SA is 100% owned by the LCH.Clearnet Group Limited (referred to as "LCH
             Group" or LCH.Clearnet) with LSEG being the ultimate controlling parent through
             its 57.8% majority shareholding in LCH Group.
   (940)     LCH SA is incorporated in France and registered as Banque Centrale de
             Compensation S.A. The management of LCH SA and almost all of its 189 employees
             are based at its headquarters in Paris. It has two additional branch offices in
             Amsterdam and Brussels as well as a representative office in Porto. There are no
             further entities belonging to the Divestment Business.
   (941)     LCH SA has been active in providing clearing services to European financial
             markets since 1998. It became part of the LCH Group in 2003 following the merger
             between the London Clearing House and Clearnet SA.
   (942)     LCH SA is a CCP authorised under EMIR which means that its clearing
             authorisations are valid across all Contracting Parties to the EEA Agreement. It is
             also regulated as a Credit Institution (with its own banking license) by the French
             supervisory authorities.
   (943)     LCH SA clears trades in a broad range of asset classes comprising both listed and
             OTC products and serves regulated markets and trading platforms across Europe.
             This includes euro denominated bonds, non-triparty and triparty repos, cash equities,
             exchange traded derivatives and commodities.
   (944)     LCH SA's main activity is clearing of derivatives and equities traded on Euronext.655
             In addition, it clears euro denominated cash bond, non-triparty repo trades (French,
             Italian and Spanish government bonds), as well as the €GC Plus triparty repo
             product.656

   (951)     The Market Test mainly aimed at allowing the Commission to assess: (i) the scope
             and effectiveness of the First Commitments, (ii) the viability of the Divestment
             Business and possible implementation risks and (iii) the suitability of Euronext as a
             purchaser of the Divestment Business.
   (952)     Overall, the results of the Market Test pointed to two main concerns relating to the
             viability of the Divestment Business in the markets for ATS traded and CCP cleared
             triparty and non-triparty repos (together referred to, for convenience as "repos
             clearing" or "repos clearing markets"), as well as for CCP clearing of bonds (together
             referred to, for convenience, as "fixed income clearing" or "fixed income clearing
             markets" for the purposes of Section 11 of this Decision).
   (953)     Given these concerns, the Commission could not conclude that the First
             Commitments would be effective to remedy all competition concerns entirely, in
             particular those relating to fixed income clearing.
   11.2.2.1. Importance of access to MTS
   (954)     The results of the Market Test, as described in greater detail in the remainder of the
             present section, clearly indicated that, for the Divestment Business to remain viable
             as regards bonds and repos clearing, access to trade feeds, and the trading platform
             MTS in particular is crucial because without access to MTS, the Divestment
             Business' market share would not be retained. This is because currently LCH SA's
             bonds and repos clearing volumes come predominantly from MTS. The market test
             also provided indications of customers' general stickiness to a trading platform as
             opposed to a clearing location in fixed income, in a sense that customers would
             prefer changing the latter rather than the former. This seems in particular to be the
             case for Italian bonds and repos, for example, where BrokerTec seems to be a
             suboptimal alternative to MTS, due to Italian domestic regulation incentivising banks
             to trade on MTS.660
   (955)     First, a clear majority of customers responding to the Commission's Market Test
             identified ownership of, or alternatively access to, MTS, as being important for the
             Divestment Business' ability to compete in fixed income clearing.661 For example,
             one market participant explained that "transferring LCH Clearnet SA while retaining
             MTS will obviously limit the ability of LCH Clearnet SA to retain even its current
             market share; let alone be a real competitor of the merged entity".662 Another market
             participant stated that "it's very difficult that it could compete as the markets [i.e.
             trading platforms] [choose] the clearer and the merged entity could not choose the
             divestment entity as one of its clearer".663
   (956)     Importantly, Euronext, the prospective buyer of the Divestment Business, also
             underlines that MTS is an "essential trading partner in ATS-traded and CCP-cleared
             non-triparty repos (and triparty) repos".664
   (957)     Moreover, a large majority of respondents to the Market Test also consider that LCH
             Ltd could use the fact that it is part of the same group as MTS to attract additional

          clearing volumes, even if it remained possible post-Transaction to clear transactions
          traded on MTS in LCH SA665 In that context, one market participant remarked that
          "it is hard to guess what proportion of market participants will move from LCH
          Clearnet SA to LCH Clearnet Ltd for MTS Trade clearing. But the risk does exist
          that the Fixed Income and repo business clearing could move almost exclusively to
          LCH Clearnet Ltd".666
   (958)  Second, in response to the question of what the customers’ reaction would be in case
          MTS were to sever the link with LCH SA, of those market participants that provided
          an informative answer and took a position667, a significant majority (26 out of 32)
          indicated they would keep on trading on MTS and move clearing to LCH Ltd,
          whereas only 6 out of 32 would switch trading platform and continue to clear with
          LCH SA.668 Those market participants explained for example that the reasons for this
          were that "MTS has quite a large user base and provides significant liquidity"669, that
          "there is a preference of a specific trading platform over CCP choice"670 and that
          "MTS platform is the main dealer to dealer platform and liquidity/activity would
          continue there, we don’t see any reason why dealers could be willing to move their
          business from MTS to Brokertec"671.
   (959)  In a similar vein, Euroclear expects that in such an event, "the most likely effect
          would […] be for these trading volumes to remain on MTS and for clearing volumes
          to move to LCH Ltd and/or Eurex Clearing. Alternatively, for clients already
          clearing some Italian government bond and repo trades in CC&G [that will also be
          part of the merged entity] an acceptable arrangement might be to keep trading on
          MTS and move clearing to CC&G".672
   (960)  The results of the Market Test, therefore, indicate that a large share of those
          customers trading on MTS would continue to do so and would switch clearing
          houses if necessary, rather than change trading platforms so as to continue clearing
          with the Divestment Business.
   (961)  In view of the network effects described in Section 5.2.1, if a large proportion of
          customers were to switch to another clearing house, and in particular to LCH Ltd,
          this would immediately make the Divestment Business less attractive for those that
          would initially stay. It could ultimately lead to a point where the majority of volume
          would tip. As a result, the Divestment Business' viability as a going concern in these
          markets would be significantly affected.
   (962)  In addition, a number of customers also indicated that the success of €GC Plus
          (LSEG triparty repo product), traded on MTS and BrokerTec, depends on access to

             MTS.673 For example, one market participant explained that "the fact that it [€ GC
             Plus] is traded on MTS could affect LCH SA"674, whereas another suggested that "a
             guarantee for the Divestment Business to be able to clear transactions conducted on
             MTS"675 could help to mitigate the risk that the ownership of MTS by €GC Plus'
             main competitor poses.
   (963)     This view is also shared by Euroclear, which provides CMS for €GC Plus, and
             considers that "the continued viability and expansion of €GC Plus obviously entirely
             depends on it receiving a sufficient number and type of trades from trading systems
             [including MTS] that are successful in capturing trading liquidity".676
   (964)     It follows that the Market Test provided clear indications that the link to MTS is an
             essential condition for the Divestment Business' continued presence and potential
             growth in the bonds and repos clearing business. The key reason for this is that LCH
             SA's clearing business in fixed income comes to a very large extent from MTS, and
             that trading feeds from BrokerTec, the largest trading platform for these instruments,
             could likely not replace this dependency were it no longer possible to clear trades
             executed on MTS in LCH SA.
   11.2.2.2. Uncertainty about the migration of the German [BUSINESS SECRETS]
             denominated government bonds to LCH SA
   (965)     The Market Test also aimed at assessing the extent to which Project [BUSINESS
             SECRETS]677 would hold in a Transaction scenario. Were this migration to occur, it
             would considerably strengthen the Divestment Business' viability in fixed income
             clearing.
   (966)     First, the Market Test results indicate that [BUSINESS SECRETS] customers are
             indeed interested in pooling their euro denominated fixed income business in a single
             CCP, due in particular to balance sheet netting opportunities arising from the
             introduction of T2S.678 In this context one market participant explained the
             circumstances in which such balance sheet netting efficiencies can be achieved
             "There are four conditions to do balance sheet netting; coincidence in the settlement
             dates, coincidence in the counterparty, coincidence of currency and coincidence of
             settlement venue. If these four conditions apply, banks are able to net different trades
             on different bonds on their balance sheets. It is clear, in view of the four conditions
             and with the incoming implementation of Target 2 Securities as settlement venue for
             all the main bonds, that concentrating volume within a single CCP (to have the same
             counterparty) will be a driving factor to get this balance sheet netting".679
   (967)     However, the results of the Market Test cast considerable doubt on whether the
             migration of further euro denominated fixed income business from LCH Ltd to LCH
             SA will happen, especially in the post-Transaction scenario where the merged entity

          would also continue clearing fixed income instruments and thus retain substantial
          liquidity.
   (968)  Even in the current situation, only few customers confirmed they are going to
          migrate. For example, when asked if they would move the clearing of all or most of
          their repo and bond volumes to LCH SA after it starts offering the clearing of
          German government bonds, only a very small number of market participants said
          they would, whereas approximately half of all respondents indicated that they would
          not move any or only small volumes and a substantial share of market participants
          explained that they would move only after substantial liquidity (open interest) has
          shifted to LCH SA.680 In this respect, for example, one respondent explained that "if
          market liquidity moves to Clearnet SA – then we would expect all or some of our
          volume to migrate. We go where market liquidity is in order to maximise netting".681
   (969)  Generally speaking, the results of the Market Test are fully consistent with the
          information obtained by the Commission during its investigation, in so far as
          liquidity is the key driver for trading (and clearing) location choices, as described in
          Section 7 above. In fact, the large majority of respondents to the market test
          indicated that liquidity is more important a factor for the choice of trading
          venue/CCP than balance sheet netting possibilities.682
   (970)  This and the fact that most customers appear only willing to move once sufficient
          liquidity has built up in LCH SA would suggest that the mere possibility of clearing
          German bonds and repos on LCH SA as of February 2017 will not automatically
          induce the business shift that [BUSINESS SECRETS] aimed to achieve.
   (971)  These results should also be seen against the important background whereby, pre-
          Transaction, LCH as a group had the incentives to encourage customers and make
          the movement happen, while this can no longer be assumed post-Transaction. Rather,
          it can even be predicted that the merged entity would likely try to prevent or reverse
          such migration. Indeed, the market test indicates that the merged entity would have
          the ability and incentive to do so. In this context approximately half of the
          respondents considered that the merged entity would be able to obstruct the
          movement of German government bonds/repos to LCH SA post-Transaction.683 For
          example, one market participant explained that the Notifying Parties would be able to
          do so because "they control the trading platforms"684 which, as explained in Section
          11.2.2.1 above, would enable them to significantly decrease LCH SA's attractiveness
          by depriving it of trades performed on MTS. This view is shared by some market
          infrastructure providers, of which BME for example explains that "the merged entity
          will do everything possible to retain the German government bonds/repos based on
          German government bonds and it will have such a strong position that it will have
          serious chances of being successful, thereby significantly hindering the movement of
          such bonds/repos to LCHClearnet SA post-merger."685

   (972)     Therefore, the migration [BUSINESS SECRETS] to LCH SA is far from certain with
             a further risk that post-Transaction the open interest would migrate towards LCH Ltd
             or another of the merged entity's clearing houses (that is to say CC&G or Eurex) that
             manages to attract a critical mass of [BUSINESS SECRETS] fixed income clearing.
   11.2.2.3. Euronext as purchaser of the Divestment Business
   (973)     Market participants generally considered that Euronext is a suitable prospective
             buyer for the Divestment Business.686 However, some market participants underline
             Euronext's lack of experience in the field of fixed income products and in relation to
             clearing services as a possible drawback, especially if the merged entity continued to
             be active through LCH Ltd and retained some of LCH Group's executive
             management responsible for LCH.Clearnet's fixed income business at group level.
   (974)     In addition, Euronext was negative about the Divestment Business' evolution
             prospects in relation to clearing of fixed income instruments. Euronext considers that
             it will not be a viable competitor in respect of the clearing of fixed income
             instruments due, in particular, to LCH SA's dependence on MTS – which would
             remain with the merged entity - and the uncertainty surrounding the implementation
             and effectiveness of [BUSINESS SECRETS].687
   11.2.2.4. Other issues arising from the Market Test
   (975)     The Market Test also provided some indications that RepoClear688, a brand intended
             to remain with LCH Ltd, could help the Divestment Business to be recognised on the
             market and strengthen its viability. For example, one market participant explained
             that "Repoclear is a strong brand, of an importance similar to that of SwapClear,
             and it has succeeded in generating momentum in the attraction of new repo clearing
             business"689 whereas another stated that "this brand is widely recognized by market
             participants today as a good tool for liquid and efficient markets. It is clearly
             associated to the business offered by LCH Clearnet SA for services covering French,
             Italian and Spain government debts, on cash and repo transactions. Its exclusion
             from the divestment business may be a clear competitive advantage for the new
             merged entity.690
   11.2.2.5. Conclusion on the results of the Market Test
   (976)     In view of the above results of the Market Test the ongoing viability of the
             Divestment Business in bonds and repos clearing was not sufficiently certain. As a
             result the Commission could not conclude that the remedy would be effective in
             practice and restore the market structures on a lasting basis, in particular in markets
             where the Transaction leads to a de facto monopoly.
   11.3.     Final Commitments
   (977)     On 27 February 2017, the Notifying Parties submitted the Final Commitments. They
             submit that those commitments comprehensively address all concerns the

           a clear-cut and appropriate structural remedy.
   11.3.1. Description of the Final Commitments
   (979)   In addition to the First Commitments, the Final Commitments comprised in
           particular:
   (a)     [THE REDACTED TEXT EXPLAINS THE IMPROVED COMMITMENTS
           OFFERED BY THE PARTIES WHICH CONSIST OF A SET OF BEHAVIOURAL
           MEASURES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO GRANTING ACCESS OF
           LCH SA TO MTS TRADE FEEDS FOR THREE YEARS, IN ADDITION TO THE
           INITIAL COMMITMENTS];
   (b)     [ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE FINAL COMMITMENTS];
   (c)     [ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE FINAL COMMITMENTS];
   (d)     [ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON THE FINAL COMMITMENTS].
   11.3.2. The Commission's assessment
   (980)   The following sections assess the suitability of the Final Commitments to address the
           Commission's concerns, and analyse in particular the scope, viability and
           effectiveness of the Final Commitments, as well their complexity and the timing of
           their submission.
   (981)   The Commitments aim at remedying the significant impediment to effective
           competition on the markets for
           –      CCP clearing of bonds,
           –      ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos,
           –      ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos,
           –      settlement and custody services in relation to fixed income provided by ICSDs
                  and large custodians,
           –      collateral management, and
           –      single-stock equity derivatives where Euronext competes with Eurex.
   (982)   First, the Commission notes that the Final Commitments, and in particular the
           divestiture of LCH SA, fully address the Commission's finding that the Transaction
           would lead to a significant impediment of effective competition in the market or
           markets for single stock equity derivatives where Eurex's main competitor Euronext
           depends on LCH SA for clearing.
   (983)   As regards the significant impediment of effective competition in bonds and repos
           clearing as well as in settlement and custody services in relation to fixed income
           provided by ICSDs and large custodians and for collateral management, the Market
           Test of the First Commitments provided in particular strong indications that the
           Divestment Business' viability was critically dependent on MTS, a trading platform
           belonging to the merged entity, and the migration of further euro denominated fixed
           income business to the Divestment Business was doubtful.
   (984)   Therefore, Sections 11.3.2.1. to 11.3.2.5. will assess the suitability of the Final
           Commitments to remedy concerns in those markets, including to what extent the
EN                                               183                                              EN

             issues revealed by the Market Test have been addressed by the Final Commitments
             in a clear-cut manner.
   11.3.2.1. Scope of the Final Commitments
   (985)     According to the Remedies Notice "the commitments have to eliminate the
             competition concerns entirely and have to be comprehensive and effective from all
             points of view".691
   (986)     First, the Final Commitments do not fully remove the overlap between the Notifying
             Parties' activities on the market for ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty repos. On
             the trading level, LSEG's MTS would remain the most important trading venue for
             €GC Plus, the key competitive constraint on DBAG's dominant GC Pooling product.
   (987)     The Market Test, as described above in Section 11.2.2, also indicated that the success
             of € GC Plus depends on access to MTS,692 which would remain part of the
             combined entity.
   (988)     The behavioural commitment according to which the Notifying Parties would be
             obliged to procure that MTS retain its link with LCH SA during a period of three
             years would maintain the high dependency of the Divestment Business on MTS,
             which would continue to have the ability to have an impact on the viability and the
             development of the business. In addition to raising issues as to whether it can be
             effectively monitored, this commitment therefore appears to be insufficient in scope.
             Moreover, the limited duration of this access commitment means that, even if it were
             to result in the intended effect for that period, it cannot be determined with the
             requisite degree of certainty that the new commercial structures arising from the
             Final Commitments would be sufficiently lasting, as required by paragraph 10 of the
             Remedies Notice.
   (989)     Further, in view of the opportunities for balance sheet netting created through T2S, it
             is vital for the Divestment Business not only to retain its current fixed income
             business in French, Spanish, and most importantly Italian bonds and repos, but also
             to attract those euro denominated volumes currently cleared in LCH Ltd to avoid
             jeopardising its current business.
   (990)     In this regard, the commitment [THE REDACTED TEXT EXPLAINS THE
             IMPROVED COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY THE PARTIES WHICH CONSIST
             OF A SET OF BEHAVIOURAL MEASURES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
             TO GRANTING ACCESS OF LCH SA TO MTS TRADE FEEDS FOR THREE
             YEARS, IN ADDITION TO THE INITIAL COMMITMENTS] is unlikely to be
             sufficient to ensure the migration of the business to the Divestment Business.
             Customers may also opt to move their business to the remaining clearing houses of
             the merged entity (Eurex and CC&G), as further discussed in the following section,
             as the Notifying Parties will have the incentive to prevent this migration and attract
             the business to their pools.
   (991)     Because the Final Commitments were submitted at a very late stage of the procedure,
             the Commission was not able to perform another market test to verify whether the

             scope of the Final Commitments was sufficient,693 and therefore cannot conclude on
             this point with the requisite degree of certainty.
   (992)     In view of the above, the Commission considers that the Final Commitments are
             insufficient in scope.
   11.3.2.2. Viability of the Divestment Business and effectiveness of the Final Commitments
   (993)     The Final Commitments are unlikely to create a competitor that would exert a
             competitive constraint on the merged entity similar to the one that exists between the
             Notifying Parties today in the area of bonds and repos clearing.
   (994)     The Market Test of the First Commitments revealed in particular that the Divestment
             Business' viability was dependent on receiving trade feeds from MTS, and attracting
             the euro denominated fixed income clearing business currently in LCH Ltd.
   (995)     As regards the dependence of the Divestment Business on MTS, it should be recalled
             that in particular as regards repos, almost all of LCH SA's business comes from
             trading on electronic platforms (ATS). On that level, the key players are MTS
             (owned by LSEG) and BrokerTec (a third party), which is currently the largest
             player.
   (996)     However, all these players have distinct strengths and weaknesses. For instance,
             MTS has a particularly strong position in trading Italian bonds and repos, whereas
             BrokerTec's strength lies more in German bonds.
   (997)     At the clearing level, the picture is similar: LCH SA (and CC&G) clears essentially
             all Italian debt, whereas LCH Ltd (and Eurex) together clear almost all German
             bonds and repos.
   (998)     This means that a [BUSINESS SECRETS] proportion of trading feeds for LCH SA
             come from MTS, as illustrated in Figure 9.
           Figure 9: Importance of MTS feeds to LCH SA
   Source: Commission's compilation of information provided by the Parties [BUSINESS SECRETS].
   693
           Pursuant to the Remedies Notice (paragraph 94), modified commitments received at a late stage of the
           procedure (i.e. after the deadline of 65 working days) have to be assessed on the basis of information
           already received in the course of the investigation, including the results of prior market testing, and
           cannot be market tested.
EN                                                      185                                                        EN

   (999)  Against this background, it is not surprising that the results of the Market Test
          indicate that the Divestment Business' viability rests in particular on having access to
          MTS' trade feeds.
   (1000) Moreover, the envisaged migration of the clearing of German and other euro
          denominated bonds and repos to the Divestment Business appears uncertain on the
          basis of the Market Test. If that open interest were to move to the Divestment
          Business, it would become the largest fixed income clearing house in Europe, and
          therefore this would evidently strengthen the Divestment Business' viability.
   (1001) However, post-Transaction, the mere possibility of clearing these types of
          transactions in the Divestment Business appears to be insufficient to make the
          migration happen. In the absence of that migration, LCH SA's existing fixed income
          business in Italian, French and Spanish bonds and repos appears to be vulnerable to
          any attempts from the Notifying Parties to shift their existing business to their own
          clearing houses.
   (1002) The Final Commitments do not allow the Commission to conclude, with the requisite
          degree of certainty, that these issues revealed by the Market Test of the First
          Commitments are satisfactorily addressed.
   (1003) First, and perhaps most importantly, under the Final Commitment the trading
          platform MTS will remain a part of the group of the merged entity. Hence, the
          Divestment Business would continue to depend on a structural link with its main
          competitors, the clearing houses of the merged entity. The behavioural commitments
          set out in the Final Commitments with a view to addressing this concern do not allow
          the Commission to conclude with the required degree of certainty that they can
          achieve this objective, for the following reasons.
   (1004) The commitment not to sever the link between the Divestment Business and MTS
          during a three year period, which resembles a type of access commitment,
          fundamentally amounts to nothing more than a promise, and does not, in the
          Commission's view, ensure with the requisite degree of certainty that the merged
          entity would not attempt to degrade this link, and thereby divert MTS' business
          elsewhere. For example, Euroclear explains that "even if MTS did not stop feeding
          [LCH] SA, MTS could degrade the quality of the feed or other aspects of its service
          to favour the merged entity and harm [LCH] SA. For example: It could modify the
          user interface to propose in sequence Ltd and in a second step [LCH] SA,
          systematically roll out technical updates to the platform to Ltd before [LCH] SA,
          [LCH] SA will have to upgrade their platform which might also require adaptation
          at the level of MTS; MTS could slow down the required adaptations on their side".694
   (1005) Second, in particular as regards ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty and
          triparty repos, the suitability and effectiveness of the Final Commitments depend in
          particular on the commercial behaviour of a third party, BrokerTec. This is because
          in particular as regards ATS trading of (non-triparty) repos, BrokerTec is MTS'
          largest competitor, and the Notifying Parties argue that its presence would continue
          to discipline MTS. However, the Commission cannot take for granted that BrokerTec
          will retain its current role. For instance, as indicated above, BrokerTec appears to be
          considering establishing a link with Eurex. The establishment of links between

          different service providers is not problematic as such and can favour competition on
          the market. However, in the context of the attempt to remedy the competition
          concerns raised by the Transaction, this link might jeopardise the viability of the
          Divestment Business and its ability to compete with the merged entity as it could end
          up without the essential trade feeds input. While the Notifying Parties called the
          potential establishment of a link between BrokerTec and Eurex as "entirely
          speculative", [BUSINESS SECRETS].695 [BUSINESS SECRETS], the Commission
          cannot determine whether post-Transaction or following the implementation of T2S,
          the merged entity might not wish to do so, in order to attempt to attract
          LCH.Clearnet's "former" fixed income business (namely LCH SA's pre-Transaction
          business and LCH Ltd's euro denominated activity).
   (1006) Third, due to the implementation of T2S, the fixed income clearing markets are
          undergoing significant changes and, as also submitted by the Notifying Parties,
          significant savings can be obtained by pooling all clearing business in one CCP. This
          implies an even greater tendency towards further concentration.
   (1007) In that context, the incentives of the merged entity to attempt to prevent the
          Divestment Business from becoming a competitive force cannot be underestimated.
          Therefore, while the Final Commitments might ensure that [DETAILS ON FINAL
          COMMITMENTS], nothing prevents the Notifying Parties from, for instance,
          attempting to strengthen CC&G, which already clears substantial fixed income
          volumes, notably Italian bonds and repos, or Eurex, or combining these two
          [BUSINESS SECRETS] fixed income clearing houses. As explained in Section 7,
          competition in the repo markets in particular will intensify post T2S implementation,
          and the Commission considers it likely that the Notifying Parties would have the
          incentive to try to counteract the stated objectives of the Final Commitments, which
          are in particular [EXPANDING LCH SA'S CLEARING OF EURO
          DENOMINATED FIXED INCOME BUSINESS ]..
   (1008) Therefore, in the absence of a clear-cut remedy such as the divestment of MTS, the
          Notifying Parties will control a large part of the Divestment Business' trading feeds
          for fixed income clearing and it is not possible to predict with the requisite degree of
          certainty how the Notifying Parties and other market participants will behave post-
          Transaction. That behaviour may have an impact on the viability of the Divestment
          Business in the fixed income clearing markets.
   (1009) As concerns the possibility of LCH SA to request access to MTS under the upcoming
          regulatory regime set out in MiFID II/MIFIR, it is unlikely that this would durably
          solve the viability concern identified in the market test. Indeed, to the extent that
          these trades would also be cleared by CCPs of the merged entity, such access would
          not be sufficient to incentivise market participants to clear trades with LCH SA as
          this would lead to the splitting of the clearing venues for their fixed income clearing
          portfolio.696 The behavioural measures set out in the Final Commitments would not
          address this issue as these measures would have been temporary697 and expire around

             the time when the open access would be certain to start applying (namely June
             2020).698
   (1010) This means that the Commission cannot determine, in particular without another
             market test, with the requisite degree of certainty that in the fixed income clearing
             markets, the Divestment Business would exert a competitive constraint on the
             merged entity similar to the one that exists between the Notifying Parties today. No
             market test could be conducted at this late stage of the procedure (15 days after the
             deadline of 65 working days). Pursuant to the Remedies Notice, the modified
             commitments had to be assessed on the basis of information already received in the
             course of the investigation, including the results of prior market testing.699
   11.3.2.3. Suitability of the Final Commitments to remove the identified competition concerns
   (1011) First, as explained in Section 11.3.2.2. above, the Final Commitments are not
             suitable to remedy the competition issues raised by the Transaction as the
             Commission cannot ascertain that the Divestment Business would be viable going
             forward in the bonds and repos clearing business.
   (1012) Second, the additional elements brought by the Final Commitments are in essence
             behavioural promises700 to engage in or abstain from a particular conduct for a
             certain period of time.
   (1013) Besides the fact that these would require intensive monitoring, the Commission can
             only accept behavioural remedies that have the potential to achieve the same effect as
             structural remedies. In this case, for the reasons set out above, the Commission
             cannot conclude with the requisite degree of certainty that the Final Commitments
             would obtain the same effect as a clear-cut structural divestment such as for example
             the divestment of MTS. For instance, a promise to maintain a link for three years
             clearly does not produce the same effect as the transfer of ownership on a lasting
             basis.
   (1014) Moreover, according to the Remedies Notice, where "the parties submit remedies
             proposals that are so extensive and complex that it is not possible for the
             Commission to determine with the requisite degree of certainty, at the time of its
             decision, that they will be fully implemented and that they are likely to maintain
             effective competition in the market, an authorisation decision cannot be granted. The
             Commission may reject such remedies in particular on the grounds that the
             implementation of the remedies cannot be effectively monitored and that the lack of
             effective monitoring diminishes, or even eliminates, the effect of the commitments
             proposed."701

           The level 2 requirements ensuring fair and open access are being finalised and will enter into
           application on 3 January 2018 with the possibility for national authorities to grant a postponement of
           the application of these rules until July 2020.

           The     Notifying     Parties     state    in    their submission    dated     27     February   2017
           "FBD_RM_064_M7995_DBAG_LSEG_Remedy Improvements Submission (27 Feb 2017)" that the
           Final Commitments are structural in nature (e.g. at paragraph 15). The Commission considers that,
           while the sale of LCH SA is structural, the rest of the commitments are behavioural ([DETAILS ON
           FINAL COMMITMENTS], commitment to maintain MTS' connection with the Divestment Business,
           etc.).

   (1015) In that context, the Commission notes that the implementation of the Final
             Commitments would entail monitoring a set of complex behavioural commitments,
             [DETAILS ON FINAL COMMITMENTS],,and access of the Divestment Business
             to MTS.
   (1016) Aside from the obvious challenges of monitoring compliance with such
             commitments in a complex industry, the Final Commitments are very broadly
             phrased and provide very little detail as regards the required conduct. For example,
             as regards the crucial access of the Divestment Business to MTS, the Final
             Commitments simply state that during a period of three years after Closing "MTS
             will maintain its connection to the Divestment Business for clearing of euro-
             denominated cash bonds and non-triparty repo products". Nothing in the Final
             Commitments defines more precisely what obligations this entails, and perhaps most
             importantly, what recourse the Divestment Business could have if the obligations
             were infringed. It should be noted that in this industry, even a temporary disruption
             could have very serious consequences, and could lead customers to reconsider the
             choice of clearing venues.
   (1017) The Remedies Notice recognises that access commitments are often complex in
             nature and therefore that "the Commission will only be able to accept such
             commitments where the complexity does not lead to a risk of their effectiveness from
             the outset and where the monitoring devices proposed ensure that those commitments
             will be effectively implemented and the enforcement mechanism will lead to timely
             results."702
   (1018) The access provisions are also devoid of any specific monitoring or enforcement
             mechanism that would allow the Commission to conclude that they are similar in
             effect to a divestment.
   (1019) Thus, while an access commitment like the one proposed by the Notifying Parties is
             by its very nature complex, particularly in this industry, the Final Commitments
             contain overly simplistic provisions that would be extremely difficult to monitor and
             enforce.
   (1020) For these reasons, the Commission considers that the Final Commitments are not
             suitable to remedy the identified competition concerns in the fixed income clearing
             markets. The Commission cannot conclude with the requisite degree of certainty that
             the Final Commitments, and in particular the access commitment obliging MTS to
             grant access to the Divestment Business, could be effectively monitored, enforced
             and this to be effective in practice.
   11.3.2.4. Complexity and timing of submission of the Final Commitments
   (1021) The Final Commitments were submitted on 27 February 2017, that is fifteen working
             days after expiry of the deadline for submitting commitments established by Article
             19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 802/2004, and hence at a very stage of the proceedings.
   (1022) As regards commitments submitted after that deadline ("late commitments"), the
             Remedies Notice provides, as explained in Section 11.1., that the Commission can
             only accept such modified commitments where it can clearly determine – on the
             basis of its assessment of information already received in the course of the
   702
           Remedies Notice, paragraph 66.
EN                                                 189                                             EN

             investigation, including the results of prior market testing, and without the need for
             any other market test – that such commitments, once implemented, fully and
             unambiguously resolve the competition concerns identified and where there is
             sufficient time to allow for an adequate assessment by the Commission and for
             proper consultation with Member States.703.
   (1023) This stricter legal standard for the assessment of late commitments has clearly been
             confirmed by the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The
             General Court stated that "It is clear from reading Article 8 of the Merger Regulation
             in conjunction with Article 18 of Regulation No 447/98 that the regulations on
             concentrations impose no obligation on the Commission to accept commitments
             submitted after the deadline. That deadline is to be explained primarily by the
             requirement of speed that characterises the general structure of the Merger
             Regulation". In addition, the General Court has identified two cumulative conditions
             that must be fulfilled so that commitments which were submitted out of time can be
             taken into account: "namely, first, that those commitments clearly, and without the
             need for further investigation, resolve the competition concerns previously identified
             and, second, that there is sufficient time to consult the Member States on those
             commitments."704
   (1024) This means that the Commission cannot accept the Final Commitments unless, on the
             basis of the available information, it can clearly determine that, once implemented,
             they will fully and unambiguously resolve all the competition concerns identified. In
             other words, the Commission cannot accept the Final Commitments if, due to
             significant uncertainties about their actual implementation or effects, it is not able to
             clearly determine that, once implemented, they will fully and unambiguously resolve
             all the competition concerns identified.
   (1025) In this case, the Commission communicated to the Notifying Parties that it would be
             willing to consider a clear cut remedy after the expiry of the deadline for submitting
             remedies.705 As the Final Commitments do not constitute a clear-cut remedy for the
             reasons set out above, no such clear-cut commitments were therefore submitted by
             the Notifying Parties.
   (1026) Therefore, for the reasons set out above the Commission rejects the Final
             Commitments also on the grounds that the Final Commitments do not allow the
             Commission to conclude that they would fully and unambiguously resolve the
             competition concerns identified in this Decision, without a further need for
             investigation.
   11.3.2.5. Conclusion
   (1027) In light of all the considerations set out above, in particular the late submission of the
             Final Commitments, their complexity, their shortcomings in terms of scope,
             effectiveness and suitability, as well as the difficulties relating to their effective
             monitoring and enforcement, the Commission concludes that the Final Commitments
             do not eliminate all the identified competition concerns, in particular in the markets
             for CCP clearing of bonds in the EEA, for ATS traded and CCP cleared triparty

            repos in the EEA, ATS traded and CCP cleared non-triparty repos in the EEA, as

            income provided by ICSDs and large custodians and for collateral management, and
            are not comprehensive and effective in all respects.
   12.      CONCLUSION
   (1028) Based on the foregoing and the available evidence, the Commission concludes that
            the Transaction is incompatible with the internal market.
