   THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
   Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
   Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 57
   thereof,
   Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of
   concentrations between undertakings1, and in particular Article 8(1) thereof,

   Whereas:
   1.         NOTIFICATION
   (1)        On 6 March 2012, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
              concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (the "Merger
              Regulation") by which the undertakings Everything Everywhere Limited
              ("Everything Everywhere"), Telefónica UK Limited ("Telefónica UK") and
              Vodafone Group Plc ("Vodafone Group") (together "the Notifying Parties"), would
              acquire, within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation, joint control
              of a newly created company constituting a joint venture (the "JV Co"), which will

            the Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the
            replacement of "Community" by "Union" and "common market" by "internal market". The terminology
            of the TFEU is used throughout this Decision.

         offer various mobile commerce ("mCommerce") services to businesses in the United
         Kingdom (the "operation").
   2.    THE NOTIFYING PARTIES
   (2)   Everything Everywhere is a joint venture created by the merger of T-Mobile UK
         and Orange UK that was declared compatible with the internal market by the
         Commission decision of 01 March 2010 in Case No COMP/M.6560 – T-
         Mobile/Orange4. Everything Everywhere is ultimately owned by France Télécom
         and Deutsche Telekom, which are involved in fixed and mobile telephony services in
         a number of EU Member States and worldwide.
   (3)   Telefónica UK is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Telefónica S.A. and belongs to the
         Telefónica Group, which mainly offers fixed and mobile telephony services in a
         number of EU Member States as well as in a number of countries outside Europe, in
         particular in Latin America.
   (4)   Vodafone Group is the holding company of a group of companies that is involved in
         the operation of mobile telecommunications networks and the provision of related
         telecommunications services. Vodafone Group has equity interests in 30 mobile
         operators globally. Vodafone Group is active elsewhere in the European Union
         through its wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries, and also has relationships with
         partner networks in over 40 further countries, including countries within the
         European Union. Vodafone UK Limited ("Vodafone UK"), a wholly owned and
         controlled subsidiary of Vodafone Group, is active in particular in the mobile
         telephony retail market in the United Kingdom.
   (5)   The JV Co would offer various services directed at business customers in the United
         Kingdom. None of the JV Co's activities would be directly provided to consumers.
         The JV Co would provide services to the Notifying Parties as well as to third party
         mobile operators (the "Service Users"). In particular the JV Co plans to offer the
         following services:
         (a)    The provision of a platform enabling the supply of (for example payment or
                ticketing) transaction services accessible offline through a Near Field
                Communication ("NFC") enabled mobile handset as well as online via the
                internet (the "Wallet Platform")5. The Wallet Platform would support the
                supply of various related NFC services including payment in shops, ticketing,
   4
       Paragraph 239.
   5
       There are two approaches to what is commonly described as a mobile wallet: (i) a container wallet: the
       container wallet at a minimum provides the consumer with an overview of all applications that are
       loaded into the secure element (see Recital (53)) and allows him or her to select which payment cards
       are switched on and off and to set priorities between them. This mobile wallet serves as a container for
       all the consumer’s virtual payment cards (the graphical user interface component) and allows the
       configuration of the secure element (the technical component) even from different card issuers, in a
       similar fashion to a consumer having several payment cards physically on his or her leather wallet; (ii)
       an app-centric wallet: it contains only one application which can include several cards, but from the
       same issuer. Each individual card stored on the secure element (for example a payment card) is
       represented by a corresponding (graphical user interface) application on the mobile handset. A card
       belonging to an individual Service Provider therefore shows up as an individual application on the
       mobile handset. In the physical word, it would be equivalent to a plastic card.
EN                                                    6                                                         EN

                             and access services as well as voucher and loyalty services, enabling the
                             provision of digital vouchers to consumers (the "Transactions"). These services
                             would be provided to commercial entities including banks, other payment card
                             issuers (credit, debit card, stored value etc.), loyalty card issuers, ticket issuers
                             and other retailers (the "Service Providers");
                    (b)     The provision and sourcing of mobile advertising platform services so as to
                             provide a single point of contact for advertisers and media agencies who wish
                             to develop advertising campaigns targeted at customers of Mobile Network
                             Operators ("MNOs") and Mobile Virtual Network Operators ("MVNOs")
                             (together "mobile operators" or M(V)NOs) whether through push messages,
                             coupons and vouchers, or through the sale of advertising space;
                    (c)     The provision of data analytics services to the JV Co's Transactions and
                             advertising customers in respect of data collected from both its Transaction
                             services and advertising services6.
     (6)            Customers of the JV Co, both Service Providers and advertisers, will still be able to
                    negotiate with the Notifying Parties individually. For example, if a card issuer
                    prefers to offer a service to the subscribers of one Notifying Party only, it remains
                    free to negotiate a price with that Notifying Party. The Notifying Party would then
                    have to use the services operated by the JV Co (for example to load the issuer’s
                    application (a mobile application ("app") is a software application designed to run on
                    smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices. They are available through
                    apps distribution platforms, which are typically operated by the owner of the mobile
                    operating system, such as the Apple App Store, Google Play, Windows Phone
                    Marketplace or BlackBerry App World) onto its mobile wallet, at a price charged to
                    the Notifying Party)7.
     3.             THE OPERATION AND THE CONCENTRATION
     (7)            The operation consists of the creation of the JV Co between Everything Everywhere,
                    Telefónica UK and Vodafone UK. Each of the shareholders will have a 33.3%
                    shareholding in the JV Co and the possibility of exercising decisive influence over it
                    through the ability to veto decisions that are essential for the strategic commercial
                    behaviour of the JV Co: appointment of senior management and determination of the
                    budget, adoption of and amendments to the Business Plan, and market-specific
                    rights8.
     6
                  The JV Co would also act as a virtual transaction processor, enabling retailers to analyse consumers'
                  retail activity. The JV Co would not actually process any transactions itself. Instead, the JV Co would
                  partner with existing third party transaction processors, acting as an intermediary in order to capture
                  basic information on online and physical purchases made by users of the mobile wallet, together with
                  certain details about the user. The JV Co could then pass this information back to the relevant merchant
                  as a value-added service. Although not a relevant product market (as the JV Co's virtual transaction
                  processor services are not being offered as a distinct product), such services are linked to the advertising
                  and data analytics elements of the JV Co.

   (8)   The board of the JV Co will consist of at least seven directors. Unanimous
          shareholder approval will be required for the appointment of the Chief Executive
          Officer, who will be the only executive director on the board. In addition, each
          Shareholder will appoint two non-executive directors to the board. Unanimous board
          approval will be required for any decision to employ or engage any senior employee
          and unanimous shareholder approval will be required for any decision to dismiss an
          executive director, officer or senior employee in circumstances in which the JV Co
          incurs or agrees to bear redundancy or other costs that exceed given thresholds.
          Unanimous board consent will be required for approval of the annual budget.
          Accordingly, Everything Everywhere, Telefónica UK and Vodafone Group will
          exercise joint control over the JV Co.
   (9)   The JV Co will employ management responsible for its day-to-day operations and
          will have access to sufficient resources, including finance, staff and assets (tangible
          and intangible) that will enable it to conduct its business activities on a lasting basis.
          The JV Co will be active on the market as an autonomous economic entity and all
          relationships with its parent companies will be at arm's length.
   (10)  Accordingly, the JV Co is a full-function joint venture performing on a lasting basis
          all the functions of an autonomous economic entity.
   (11)  The operation therefore constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article
          3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation9.
   4.    UNION DIMENSION
   (12)  The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover for the
          year 2010 of more than EUR 5 000 million10 (Everything Everywhere (France
          Télécom: EUR […]* , Deutsche Telekom: EUR […]*), Telefónica UK: EUR […]*,
          Vodafone Group: EUR […]*). Each of the undertakings concerned has a Union-
          wide turnover for the year 2010 in excess of EUR 250 million (Everything
          Everywhere (France Télécom: EUR […]*, Deutsche Telekom: EUR […]*),
          Telefónica UK: EUR […]*, Vodafone Group: EUR […]*), without achieving more
          than two-thirds of their aggregate Union-wide turnover within one and the same
          Member State.
   (13)  The operation therefore has a Union dimension within the meaning of Article 1(2) of
          the Merger Regulation.
        […]* (Annex 4 to Form CO: Note on Jurisdiction, point 2.8).
   9
        Therefore, the argument put forward by Three UK, considering that the JV Co would be "akin to a joint
        selling agreement" is irrelevant (response from Three UK to Questionnaire Q1 of 7 March 2012,
        question 105; agreed minutes of telephone conference call of 13 February 2012 with Three UK).

   5.    PROCEDURE
   (14)   The operation was notified to the Commission on 6 March 2012.
   (15)   On 13 April 2012, the Commission raised serious doubts as to the compatibility of
          the operation with the internal market and initiated proceedings pursuant to Article
          6(1)(c) of the Merger Regulation ("the Article 6(1)(c) Decision").
   (16)   On 20 April 2012, the Notifying Parties requested access to key documents necessary
          for the preparation of the Article 6(1)(c) Decision. On 23 April 2012, a non-
          confidential version of certain key statements of third parties collected during the
          Commission's first phase investigation was provided to the Notifying Parties after the
          Article 6(1)(c) Decision.
   (17)   Following the initiation of proceedings, the Notifying Parties provided several
          separated submissions replying to specific aspects raised in the Article 6(1)(c)
          Decision.
   (18)   On 2 May 2012, the Notifying Parties requested an extension of the time period for
          the second phase investigation by 17 working days pursuant to the second sub-
          paragraph of Article 10(3) of the Merger Regulation.
   6.    INVESTIGATION OF THE OPERATION
   (19)   Given the complexity of the case, considering in particular the complex nascent markets
          at stake, the Commission has sought to make use of all available means of investigation
          pursuant to Article 11 of the Merger Regulation.
   (20)   The Commission took a number of investigative steps in order to ascertain the most
          likely outcome of the operation11. The Commission analysed questionnaires which
          were sent, inter alia, to competing M(V)NOs, handset manufacturers (or Original
          Equipment Manufacturers, ("OEMs")), mobile operating system ("OS") providers,
          financial institutions, retailers, advertising agencies, data analytics providers, and
          bulk Short Message Service ("SMS") aggregators.12 The Commission also undertook
          other written and oral contacts with these market participants and other third parties
          such as the telecommunication regulator in the United Kingdom Ofcom, the GSM
          Association ("GSMA")13, and consumer associations. In addition, the Commission
   11
        Paragraph 21 of the non-horizontal merger guidelines: "The Commission examines the various chains
        of cause and effect with a view to ascertain which of them is the most likely".
   12
        The market investigation included four questionnaires in first phase: Q1 – "Questionnaire to MNOs and
        MVNOs", Q2 – "Questionnaire to providers of mobile payment, advertising and data analytics
        services", Q3 - "Questionnaire to customers of mobile payment, advertising and data analytics services"
        and Q4 – "Questionnaire to handset manufacturers. Seven questionnaires were launched in second
        phase, including to additional addressees: R1 – "Questionnaire to financial services providers", R2 –
        "Questionnaire to handset manufacturers and/or mobile OS developers", R3 – "Questionnaire to mobile
        advertising customers/competitors", R4 – "Questionnaire to Independent Distributors and Resellers",
        R5 – "Questionnaire to Bulks SMS Aggregators and Customers", R6 – "Questionnaire to data analytics
        providers" and R7 – "Questionnaire to MNOs and MVNOs".

        The GSM Association (GSMA) is an association of mobile operators and related companies devoted to
        supporting the standardisation, deployment and promotion of the GSM mobile telephone system. The
        GSMA was formed in 1995 (see more information at http://gsma.com).

          analysed a substantial amount of internal documents belonging to the Notifying
          Parties, and to several third parties. Given the nascent state of the markets under
          consideration, there is limited data available and therefore no extensive empirical
          analysis could be undertaken. On the other hand, the Commission considered and
          assessed a numerical analysis of foreclosure incentives submitted by the Notifying
          Parties.
   (21)   In its assessment, the Commission also took into account as general background
          information the facts described in the Green Paper "Towards an integrated European
          markets for card, internet, and mobile payments"14.
   (22)   Against this background, it is important to stress that the assessment of the competitive
          impact of the operation involves a complex legal and economic analysis, the results of
          which are based on the totality of the available evidence15.
   (23)   In particular regarding the questionnaires, it is important to note that the market
          investigation is by no means an opinion poll. For instance, the fact that the majority of
          third parties provide a similar opinion in reply to a specific question, can only be an
          indication for the Commission’s own investigation, not a foregone conclusion.
          Likewise, it would not be appropriate to assume that the answers to the questionnaires
          can always be considered as being thought-through objectively. The specific level of
          knowledge of third parties may vary (this is in particular relevant in this Decision,
          considering the fact that relevant markets are nascent), the questions may have been
          misunderstood, the replies may be more or less representative, and the opinion provided
          might be biased to influence the Commission's decision-making process in a certain
          way16.
   (24)   As in any other merger investigation, the Commission has therefore carefully analysed,
          interpreted and weighed all views expressed during the market investigation. However,
          the Commission considers that the relevant statements had to be weighed against all
          available evidence. It is also important to stress that the market investigation is an on-
          going process, in the course of which the Commission usually refines and narrows the
          issues analysed and clarifies unclear and contradictory opinions with third parties.
   (25)   As a result, not only were various written questionnaires sent, but detailed interviews
          were carried out, to tackle potential omissions in some responses, to clarify unclear
          opinions from the written responses and to learn more about some key factual aspects of
          the case. The minutes of these interviews were sent to the interviewees for correction

        See Commission decision of 27 June 2007, Case No COMP/M.4439 - Ryanair/Aer Lingus, paragraphs
        35 and following. According to this Decision, the fact that single pieces of evidence may not support a
        certain conclusion, cannot as such call into question the Commission’s assessment, since the
        Commission cannot base its decision on one single piece of evidence, but must collect as much
        evidence as possible, analyse all available facts and opinions and weigh all the available evidence when
        deciding on the compatibility of a transaction with the internal market.
   16
        In particular, the Commission analyses opinions by (potential) competitors very carefully, since these
        might have an interest in making the transaction of their competitors more difficult.

   7.       BACKGROUND INFORMATION
   7.1.     Introduction to mCommerce
   (26)     The operation takes place in the new but fast growing mCommerce sector, which
            encompasses mobile payments, mobile advertising and data analytics.
   7.1.1.   The rise of smartphones and tablets
   (27)     The development of mCommerce has been made possible by the rapid market
            penetration of smartphones (such as Apple's iPhone, handsets supporting Google's
            Android mobile OS, Research in Motion's Blackberry, and Nokia's future mobile
            handsets supporting Microsoft's Windows Phone platform) in the United Kingdom,
            and the consequent supply of new services for mobile handsets18.
   (28)     The functionalities available through mobile handsets19 has been gradually increasing
            for many years. However, this has increased exponentially since the introduction of
            smartphones, with consumers increasingly expecting their mobile handsets to
            perform more functions.
   (29)     The uptake of smartphones in the United Kingdom has also been remarkably rapid,
            as illustrated in Table 1 below20. This growth is expected to continue, with shipments
            predicted to double by 2015. Most industry commentators believe that smartphones
            will dominate the future market for mobile phones, with the potential impact that
            internet use may quickly become the primary use of mobile handsets21.
   17
          Where answers were unclear or contradictory, the Commission generally attached greater weight to the
          interview held after the written reply and aimed at clarifying the written answers.
   18
          For the purpose of this decision, mobile handsets are defined as any device which can make or receive
          voice calls or SMS/Multimedia Messaging Service ("MMS") messages over the mobile networks.
   19
          For the purpose of this Decision, smartphones are mobile handsets operated through and advanced OS
          and have for example access to the internet.
   20
          Ofcom Communications Market Report 2011, figure 5.20.
   21
          The International Data Corporation European Mobile Phone Tracker research, March 2011 found that
          smartphones accounted for 44% of all new mobile handsets shipped in Western Europe in the fourth
          quarter of 2010, an increase of 99.4% on the same period in 2009. The International Data Corporation
          predicts that, by 2015, the number of smartphones being shipped will have doubled compared to 2011;
          this is compared with overall mobile handset market growth of only 3.2% between 2010 and 2011.

   Table 1: Market penetration of smartphones in the United Kingdom
   (30)      This rapid uptake has resulted in smartphones comprising a significant - and fast-
             growing - segment of mobile handsets. According to the Notifying Parties, around
             [70-80]% of all mobile users in the United Kingdom are expected to have a
             smartphone by 2015. Recent industry reports have stated that the number of
             smartphones sold exceeded the number of Personal Computers ("PCs") sold over the
             course of 201122.
   (31)      Smartphones can be differentiated from traditional mobile phones because they are
             operated through an advanced OS (such as Apple iOS or Google Android23) that
             enables various features that are similar to PCs, including easier internet connectivity
             by enabling the use of open browsers that are similar to those used on PCs and not
             restricted to the websites they can browse, the ability to download and install a very
             wide variety of apps, multiple communication options including emails, internet
             protocol ("IP") based notifications through apps ("IP-based push notifications"),
             greater processing power, and larger screens. These attributes enable consumers to
             use their mobile phones for a variety of tasks that could previously only be
             performed on static PCs24 in an even more convenient manner because most
             consumers carry their smartphone with them at all times and, because the device is
             always powered on, it makes it much simpler to use for everyday tasks such as
             checking emails than using a PC (which requires booting up etc.). This also includes
             carrying out functions that, until recently, would have been seen as involving
             information too sensitive to be sent by or kept on a mobile handset (for example,

           The Ofcom Communications Market Report 2011, section 1.7.9, notes that 32% of households in the
           United Kingdom now use their mobile handset to access data services (internet, emails, web-enabled
           apps etc.) and such use also takes place in the home, not just when away from a traditional PC. The
           Ofcom Communications Market Report 2011, section 1.5.6, also notes that 33% of adult smartphone
           users in the United Kingdom stated that their mobile handset is the most important device for accessing
           the internet. Smartphones are also configured to run through Wi-Fi networks (Wi-Fi is a popular
           technology that allows an electronic device to exchange data wirelessly (using radio waves) over a
           computer network, including high-speed Internet connections).

           mobile banking, which is now offered by most high street banks in the United
           Kingdom, allows consumers to receive account information via SMS)25.
   (32)    A recent study shows that consumers in the United Kingdom are increasingly using
           their mobile handsets to access the internet26. Nearly 8.8 million mobile owners in
           the United Kingdom used an app that connected to the internet during April 2011,
           with Google Maps ranking as the most accessed app with 6.4 million unique users,
           followed by Yahoo's Weather app with 3.6 million users and Facebook's app with 3.5
           million unique visitors.
   (33)    Parallel to the increased uptake of smartphones, tablets are also becoming
           increasingly popular with consumers. The mobility, and therefore convenience, of
           tablets, together with functionality which is near-identical to most PCs, has resulted
           in consumers choosing to purchase a tablet rather than a PC. A recent report by
           Gartner has shown that European sales of PCs have fallen 11% as a result of
           increased switching to tablets27.
   (34)    One of the features of smartphones is the presence of an OS. The OS owners enter
           into agreements with both OEMs and M(V)NOs. Generally, each MNO is likely to
           enter into a variety of contractual arrangements with OS providers. These typically
           include licence agreements, app development agreements (developer agreements on
           standard OS provider terms to develop and supply apps to end users using the
           relevant OS platform); and commercial agreements for the provision of services
           […]*.
   (35)    Fuller contractual arrangements are more commonly entered into between the OS
           provider and the OEM, rather than the MNO. For example, an MNO may purchase a
           mobile handset from a particular OEM (such as Samsung) which happens to run on
           Android OS. The MNO may wish to specify a certain amount of customisation on
           that handset, such as including particular apps on the mobile handset's homescreen.
           However, the ensuing licence agreement will be between the OS provider and the
           OEM, rather than with the MNO (except where the OEM and the OS provider are the
           same entity: […]*.
   (36)    MNOs also have contractual agreements with OEMs regarding the supply of mobile
           handsets that are sold via the MNOs' retail channels. The type of purchasing
           agreements entered into (in terms of geographical scope of purchasing contracts, or
           the selection criteria for mobile handsets) varies between the different Notifying
           Parties. As part of these purchasing agreements, […]* can be negotiated28.

   (37)     Kantar Worldpanel find that the Android OS now makes up the largest proportion of
            smartphones, with a share in the big five countries (Germany, the United Kingdom,
            France, Italy and Spain) growing from 38.8% in May 2011 to 60% in May 2012.
            Android also retained its leading position in the United Kingdom in the 12 weeks of
            sales preceding 13 May 2012 with 52.5% share, increased from 48.3% a year ago.
            Samsung took 56% of these sales and HTC holds 29%. iOS, the mobile OS of Apple
            increased its share of the smartphone market in the United Kingdom in the 12 weeks
            of sales preceding 13 May 2012 from 21.4% a year before to 30.9%29.
   (38)     As a further background element, the Commission, considering the replies to the
            market investigation, is of the view that since, as will be discussed in section 7.1.3,
            the technology used is based on NFC which does not depend on a mobile signal such
            as 3G or 4G (3rd and 4th generation of mobile telecommunications technology), and
            the main difference between 3G and 4G will be speed and capacity of connection,
            which are not relevant parameters for the assessment of this operation, the
            introduction of 4G/LTE (Long Term Evolution) will not affect the conditions of
            competition for mobile wallet services or advertising and data analytics to any
            material extent.
   7.1.2.   Retail mobile telephony in the United Kingdom
   (39)     The Notifying Parties are the three biggest MNOs in the United Kingdom. There is a
            fourth MNO in the United Kingdom, Three UK, which is not party to the JV Co30.
   (40)     According to Ofcom’s Communications Market Report from August 2011, the
            Notifying Parties account for 90.5% of retail mobile revenues (including revenues
            derived from MVNOs)31 in the United Kingdom. Three UK market share is 9.5% in
            2010, 0.8% higher than the year previously. Three UK is however the fastest
            growing of the four MNOs and has an estimated market share of [10-20]% when
            considering smartphones only (smartphones are required for customers to obtain
            mobile wallet services, making smartphone market shares a relevant element for the

          market share of Three UK is slightly lower, at 7% in 2010 and the Notifying Parties (including
          connections derived from MVNOs) account for 93% (page 15 of the Ofcom report). The total market
          share of parties outside of the JV Co (including MVNOs and Three UK) in the retail mobile market had
          risen to over [10-20]% during the first half of 2011 considering revenues, and were around [10-
          20]% considering subscriber numbers (see Annex 40 to Form CO, page 3).

          is more than 136% in October 2011 the United Kingdom34.
   (41)   The Notifying Parties submit that around 100 MVNOs are operating in the United
          Kingdom. These include retailers in other sectors with established brands and
          distribution networks such as Virgin Mobile, or the retailers Tesco and Asda. Others
          such as Lebara Mobile and Lyca Mobile serve niche markets (for example migrant
          communities). The Notifying Parties submit that there seems to have been an entry
          wave in 2010/2011. For 2010 it was estimated that the total market share of MVNOs
          in terms of revenues was around [5-10]%35. The Commission notes that this figure
          submitted by the Notifying Parties constitutes a conservative estimate in comparison
          to the market share figures estimated by Ofcom.
   (42)   In the United Kingdom, mobile handsets are sold directly in the shops of the
          Notifying Parties. However, the indirect channels, such as Carphone Warehouse36
          and Phones 4U, account for a significant proportion of the retail mobile handset
          supply market. Data submitted by the Notifying Parties indicate that independent
          retailers would have a market share of at least around [40-50]% for mobile handsets37.
          […],an independent consultancy, estimates that on a sales value basis, Carphone
          Warehouse and Phones 4U jointly have a market share of [40-50]%38. In addition,
          end- customers can turn to generalist stores, such as Comet, Tesco and Argos, as well
          as internet-only retailers.

   (44)   Post-pay mobile subscriptions rose to 48.7% of United Kingdom subscribers in 2010
          from 34.4% in 2005 (from 22.6 to 39.5 million subscriptions). For post-pay
          subscriptions the majority of mobile handsets are subsidised. Subsidies for pre-pay

             subscriptions have largely been phased-out since May 201140. The contract duration
             of post-pay contracts in the United Kingdom has increased in recent years (2-year
             contracts accounted for 70% of new subscriptions in 2010 whereas in 2005 88% of
             new subscriptions were only 12 months contracts). Post-pay contract subscribers
             spend three times as much per user as pre-paid users, and make 73.9% of all calls in
             the United Kingdom.
   (45)      The smartphones needed to run mobile payments and mCommerce apps are mostly
             (77%) sold subject to a post-pay contract. Smartphones now account for over 48% of
             mobile handset sales in the United Kingdom41.
   7.1.3.    Mobile Transactions
   (46)      Accompanying the rise of smartphones has been the growth of mobile transactions:
             allowing consumers to carry out financial and other transactions using their mobile
             handsets online via the internet. Consumers in the United Kingdom are increasingly
             using mobile phones to carry out transactions of all types. The recent […]*
             mCommerce survey42 indicates that mobile online transactions have already become
             widely used in the United Kingdom, with 51% of consumers (around 23 million
             people) using their mobile handset to make payments, redeem coupons or research
             products and services. Whilst mobile payments currently account for only a tiny
             fraction of all payments, the Notifying Parties submit that a high uptake is forecast
             for both online payments and physical transactions using NFC technology.
   7.1.3.1. Online payments
   (47)      A number of internet companies ( or over the top ("OTT") players - companies with
             no traditional mobile networking capability but with the ability to provide services
             using data connectivity over mobile handsets) and financial services entities have
             announced plans to become active in providing mobile and online payments
             platforms:
             (a)    Google has integrated its Google Checkout service into Google Wallet43.
                    Google Wallet will also be integrated within the Android Market, YouTube
                    and Google+.44 This means, according to the Notifying Parties, that users of
                    Google Checkout in the United Kingdom (which primarily operates in the
                    same way as PayPal, by providing an online payment facility), can now be sent
                    coupons and vouchers, whether to their mobile handset or registered PC;
             (b)    PayPal is already offering consumers in the United Kingdom the capability to
                    link their credit or debit card to a mobile handset number in the United
                    Kingdom and then use this to make purchases. This is in addition to PayPal's

                existing online commerce activities, which are accessible through mobile
                handsets. PayPal also unveiled in May 2012 a new app called 'inStore' that will
                allow customers to pay in store by generating a barcode on the screen of the
                handset that the shop will scan to take the money from the customer's
                account45;
        (c)    Apple's consumers in the United Kingdom registered with its iTunes service -
                which is included as a pre-loaded app on all iPhones - can register their card
                details in iTunes, and use that to purchase a wide range of goods through their
                iPhone or iPad in the Apple app store. Apple announced on 11 June 2012 that it
                would be launching Passbook, as part of its next generation of mobile OS,
                iOS6. Passbook is an application that will include event tickets, travel passes,
                coupons and merchant loyalty cards. Initially it will be limited to pre-paid
                cards. The Notifying Parties speculate that since Apple has consumer's credit
                cards registered through iTunes, it could develop payment functions on this
                basis. The Notifying Parties further consider that although it is possible that
                Apple might not launch an NFC wallet in the iPhone 5 – some have speculated
                that it might wait to see how the mobile wallet market develops first – it can be
                regarded as highly likely that they would follow up within one year, or at the
                very latest two years. If Apple were to leave it longer than 2-3 years before
                entering the market, it would run a significant risk of losing market share in
                mobile handsets, as consumers would seek out mobile handset alternatives with
                mobile wallet capability46;
        (d)    Visa announced in April 2012 the launch of V.me47. By end 2012 V.me will
                allow customers in the United Kingdom to store one or more of their Visa,
                MasterCard, American Express or Discovery cards on a V.me account. When
                ready to pay at a merchant website, customers will be able to access the card
                they want to use by entering their V.me email address and password during the
                checkout process, rather than their credit card details. V.me is expected to offer
                mobile payment and discount facility in the future, similar to the JV Co
                facility.
        (e)    MasterCard also announced one week later than the launch of V.me the
                launch of its PayPass Wallet Services48. The PayPass Wallet is an extension of
                MasterCard’s already existing PayPass brand, which offers tap-and-go, NFC-
                enabled payments that work via PayPass-enabled (NFC) phones, cards, key
                fobs, or mobile tags. Like V.me, MasterCard’s PayPass Wallet will allow
                consumers to add their Visa, American Express and Discover cards, whether
                credit, debit or prepaid to the Paypass Wallet;

             (f)    The Mobile Money Network49 ("MMN") recently launched a mobile online
                    checkout service in the United Kingdom called "Simply Tap"50;
             (g)    Microsoft announced at its Windows Phone Summit on 20 June 2012 that
                    every new Windows Phone 8 will include a "Google Wallet-like", NFC-
                    enabled contactless payment feature called Wallet Hub51. Microsoft sees its
                    future mobile wallet as a hub which could integrate several financial and
                    payment instruments and additional services such as loyalty points, coupons
                    and vouchers52. From a technical perspective, the Microsoft wallet would not
                    be an app, but rather an ecosystem in which the financial instruments (such as
                    credit cards) are itself apps. Microsoft states that the Microsoft wallet will be
                    preloaded on all windows phones. Every version of a Windows Phone will
                    come with a version of the wallet but not all of them will necessarily be used
                    for payment instruments53.
   (48)      In addition, there are a number of other mobile payment ("mPayment") solutions on
             the market which, although they are not contactless in the NFC sense, enable
             transactions to be processed "on the move" without the typical point of sale ("PoS")
             terminal. Examples include one dimension barcode or double dimension quick
             response. These are payments taken by scanning a barcode on the handset screen54.
             PayPal also offers the ability to pay in store, for example Pizza Express restaurants in
             the United Kingdom, with a PayPal account55.
   7.1.3.2. NFC technology
   (49)      The technology used for undertaking contactless physical transactions on mobile
             phones is anticipated to be principally based on NFC technology. NFC is essentially
             a technology standard56, which enables secure short range communication between
             any handset with the relevant chipset in it and another similarly enabled handset
             (typically a reader), when it is placed within a short distance (typically 3-5mm). The
             Notifying Parties submit that NFC-based transactions are already becoming

           The Mobile Money Network is a joint venture between Best Buy Europe and Monitise plc. It also has

           With Simply Tap, participating retailers sign up and provide product codes for their products.
           Consumers register with MMN by downloading the MMN app and then by storing their profile and
           card details. After initial registration, when a consumer views an advert or sees a product online or in-
           store, they can type the product code into the app or send the product code via SMS to purchase the
           product without having to re-enter their details. The Simply Tap service is available on any handset
           with any MNO, can be linked with any payment card and has the potential to be used in any United
           Kingdom merchant's store. It was launched in November 2011 and has signed up with retailers
           including The Carphone Warehouse.

          widespread in a variety of contexts, such as building access, transport and
          payments57.
   (50)   An NFC device can communicate in active or passive mode. An NFC passive tag,
          displayed on a poster or embedded in a plastic card can be read by an active NFC
          handset. In this case the initiator (the mobile handset) generates a radio signal and the
          target is powered by an electromagnetic field.
   (51)   As a consequence of this active/passive mode, there are three possibities of
          interaction which have been chosen by the industry (NFC forum):
          (a)     The Reader/Writer mode: the NFC handset read the passive tag. This situation
                  is similar to the barcode or Quick Response communication method.
          (b)     The Card Emulation Mode: the handset is working in passive mode and the
                  reader in active mode. This is the classic situation of contactless card or
                  transport ticketing.
          (c)     The Peer-to-Peer ("P2P") mode: the two devices are in active mode and can
                  exchange information. This mode could be used for person to person exchange
                  of data (business card) or cloud58-based payments.
   (52)   For NFC-based mobile payments to be made, the mobile handset should in particular
          contain an NFC antenna, and a Secure Element (“SE”).
   (53)   The SE is a piece of hardware and software capable of securely hosting apps and
          their confidential and cryptographic data in accordance with the rules and security
          requirements set out in a set of well identified trusted authorities.
   (54)   There are several possible locations for an SE in the case of a payment transaction
          performed via a mobile handset:
          (a)     On the Subscriber Identification Module ("SIM") card59;
          (b)     On a (micro)Secure Digital ("SD") card which can be integrated in some
                  mobile handsets, including at the same time the NFC technology;
          (c)     On an external device such a Universal Serial Bus ("USB") key;
   57
        Aside from NFC, there are a number of other contactless technologies on the market, including blue-
        tooth and Radio frequency identification (RFID).
   58
        Cloud computing is a technology that uses the internet and central remote servers to maintain data and
        applications. Cloud computing allows consumers and businesses to use apps without installation and
        access their personal files at any computer with internet access. This technology is said to allow for
        much more efficient computing by centralizing storage, memory, processing and bandwidth.
   59
        A Universal Integrated Circuit Card ("UICC") is used in the mobile communications industry, as
        defined in ETSI TS 102 221. UICC is a new generation SIM card included in mobile phones or laptops
        used in some high speed wireless 3G networks. The UICC can store contacts and enables a secure and
        reliable voice and multi-media data connection, global roaming and remotely adds new apps and
        services. Smaller in size than a full card, it contains a computer, or microprocessor, its own data storage
        and software. It is an evolution of the SIM used to identify subscribers in GSM networks. As UICC is
        still often referred to as a SIM card in the industry, the term SIM card will be used throughout the
        present Decision for the sake of ease of reference.

         (e)   In the cloud.
   (55)  The SE is provided by an issuer. The SE issuer is a trusted party responsible for the
         issuance and maintenance of an SE. Typically it will be the MNO for SIM-based
         SEs, the OEM or OS provider for embedded SEs, and the SE supplier for external
         SEs. The issuer has control over access to the SE.
   (56)  The cost of an embedded SE or of a SIM-based SE is low, in particular in
         comparison with the price of a smartphone. Moreover, with mass production, the SE
         cost is likely to diminish.
   (57)  SPs are banks, other payment card (credit, debit, stored value etc.) issuers, loyalty
         card issuers, ticket issuers, etc. that will be able to offer their mobile services (mobile
         payment, mobile ticketing, mobile couponing, etc.) to customers via the JV Co.
   (58)  SPs need to have their mobile services apps installed in the mobile handset. For
         security reasons some of these apps can be hosted only on a SE.
   (59)  To personalise the mobile app and load it on the SE, one or more Trusted Service
         Managers (“TSMs”) are used.
   (60)  TSMs ensure the technical connections between SPs and SEs and provide end-to-end
         security between them.
   (61)  The services provided by TSMs include the provisioning of virtual (payment) cards
         in the mobile wallet, the personalising of these cards, and the lifecycle management
         of these cards. A TSM combines data delivery with security. Once a TSM has
         provisioned a payment app, it is not involved in the payment process itself. In
         practice, different TSMs are often used on the SP side and SE issuer side.
   (62)  In the case of the JV Co, the interconnection between the SE issuer, the mobile
         wallet provider and the app provider is managed by the mobile wallet platform. The
         platform will provide and manage the services infrastructure, as well as enabling the
         mobile wallet provider and the app provider to have their product stored on the SE.
   (63)  The JV Co would procure TSM services from third parties to enable them to be
         offered as part of the mobile wallet platform. The JV Co would not be active in
         supplying TSM services as a standalone service as these services constitute an
         integral element of the mobile wallet platform. The market for the provision of TSM
         services currently comprises a small number of international suppliers (such as
         Gemalto, Oberthur and Giesecke & Devrient). It appears that some IT companies
         would be entering in this new market, and Visa and MasterCard would have recently
         offered their clients (the banks) a package composed of both a mobile wallet itself
         and TSM services for V.me and PayPass wallet60.

   (64)   There are between 1 million and 1.5 million PoS payment terminals in the United
          Kingdom. Around 250,000 of these are NFC-enabled but not active yet61. By the end
          of September 2011, 73,000 outlets in the United Kingdom were ready to accept
          NFC-based payments62. It is expected that the number of NFC terminals would reach
          120,000 by the 2012 London Olympics, and that over the next few years the PoS
          terminal replacement cycle will most likely lead to all PoS terminals becoming NFC-
          enabled63.
   (65)   Following banks' interest, many major retailers with a high number of low-value
          transactions – such as McDonalds, EAT, Pret à Manger - have started rolling out
          NFC PoS terminals as well. It is also estimated that 80% of London transit journeys
          are currently made via the Oyster contactless card64 and Transport for London is
          planning to introduce contactless payments across its network by the end of 2012
          (starting with equipping all London buses with NFC capability for the 2012 Olympic
          Games)65.
   (66)   NFC can be provided in a number of formats, such as payment cards, tablets,
          stickers, key fobs66 and tags. Banks are currently leading the roll out of NFC
          technology in the transactions field by implementing NFC in their credit and debit
          cards. It is estimated that there are currently 19.6 million contactless payment cards
          in circulation in the United Kingdom (in September 2011)67.
   (67)   Furthermore, the limit for a single contactless card transaction (without entering a
          PIN) will increase from GBP 15 to GBP 20 during summer 2012. The Notifying
          Parties submit that many retailers with transaction values within the range currently
          allowed for contactless card payments are evaluating installing new PoS terminals
          and are either changing PoS terminals at the moment or have plans to do so as part of
          their regular replacement cycle68.
   (68)   Loyalty cards are also expected to provide an opportunity for rapid mass adoption of
          the mobile transaction technology, as it would represent a significant cost saving
          opportunity for retailers that would no longer have to issue plastic loyalty cards.
   (69)   For these reasons, it is expected that some level of early adoption of mobile
          transaction or payment technology will take place in 2012, even though mass
          adoption of mobile payment technology is not expected to happen within 3-4 years,
          as customers will need to upgrade their mobile handsets (which they do on average

        A key fob is a small security hardware device with built-in authentication used to control and secure
        access to network services and data. The key fob displays a randomly generated access code, which
        changes periodically, usually every 30 to 60 seconds. A user first authenticates themselves on the key
        fob with a personal identification number (PIN), followed by the current code displayed on the device.

            every two years), PoS terminals will need to be updated or replaced, and mobile
            wallets will need to be introduced to customers.
   (70)     As far as the introduction of mobile wallets is concerned, a number of initiatives
            have already been introduced in the United Kingdom and several additional plans
            have been announced to increase the use of mobile wallets. In particular, Everything
            Everywhere's Orange/Barclaycard QuickTap product has been available for some
            months in the United Kingdom, and on 27 February 2012 Vodafone announced its
            intention to develop a mobile wallet with Visa, and Telefónica launched its O2 wallet
            in the United Kingdom at the end of April 201269.
   (71)     The JV Co would develop a new offer to customers in the United Kingdom in terms
            of mobile payment and other transactions. The JV Co would offer services to
            business customers: on the one hand, it would contract with card issuers (bank card
            issuers, retailers) that would wish to include their cards in the mobile wallet to be
            offered to customers by retail providers of mobile wallets; on the other hand, the JV
            Co would contract with MNOs and MVNOs.
   (72)     MNOs (and MVNOs) would then offer a mobile wallet to their customers, allowing
            them to make contactless offline payments using NFC, redeem electronic vouchers
            and register loyalty points at brick and mortar merchants by tapping their mobile
            phones against a NFC-enabled terminal, and to carry out online payments.
   7.1.4.   Other mPayments initiatives across the world
   (73)     Reflecting the growth in popularity of mobile transactions, there are a number of
            initiatives currently underway across the world in respect of NFC mobile wallets70,
            which appear to have some similarities to the JV Co's services.

          There are also a wide range of initiatives in relation to online payment wallets. For example, Atos
          Worldine, Bouygues Telecom, Orange and SFR have launched a common service "Buyster" which aims
          to develop, operate and sell an innovative online payment service based on mobile technology. The
          commercial service was launched in September 2011. For completeness, Telefónica O2 Czech
          Republic, Vodafone Czech Republic a.s. and T-Mobile a.s are also shareholders in the Mopet CZ a., the
          "Mobile Cash – the Real Time Transaction Centre" ("RTTC"), a co-operation between banks and
          MNOs for the creation of a countrywide mobile payments solution. The banks are responsible for
          linking their existing customers' accounts to the RTTC. The participating MNOs facilitate the use of m-
          payments applications. The RTTC itself is responsible for the acquisition of merchants, the operation of
          the centre and the development of the mPayments application. The RTTC mobile cash and related
          mobile wallet application can be used for remote payments for goods and services, in-store payments
          for goods and services, P2P payments between users, and mobile top-ups. […]*.

   (74)   Japanese consumers have had mobile wallets, offering functionality similar to that
          proposed by JV Co, for approximately 6 years. These are based on an embedded
          card, enabling the mobile handset to be used for many forms of mCommerce,
          including train tickets, mobile payments, vending machines, membership services
          and identification for building entry. These mobile payments are based on Felica, a
          predecessor of NFC. However, in December 2011, a new joint venture between NTT
          Docomo, KDDI and Softbank Mobile was set up with a view to coordinating the
          switch from non-NFC mPayments to NFC technology. It is expected that the switch
          would be made in 201271.
   (75)   In the United States of America, AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon are planning to
          create their own NFC payment platform, called ISIS, which will offer a mobile
          wallet, membership and loyalty programme, and personalised coupons and rewards.
          The platform will target the MNOs' large customer base. ISIS has so far signed
          agreements with all four American payment networks and is expected to be launched
          by summer 2012, with pilots in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Austin, Texas72.
   (76)   A number of initiatives have also been announced inter alia in Germany73, the
          Netherlands74, Sweden75, Denmark76, France77, and Spain78.
   (77)   Overall, the mCommerce sector is nascent and dynamic. There are numerous
          different mCommerce initiatives being developed in the United Kingdom at the
          moment which are at different stages of maturity and adoption (for example
          Orange/Barclaycard QuickTap, PayPal "In Store").
   (78)   Currently, it is unclear which technologies will ultimately be adopted by consumers
          and merchants alike. At this stage, therefore, there seems to be inter-technology
          competition (for example NFC-based payments with SIM-based SE, with embedded
          SE, with SEs added to micro SD cards or sleeves or stickers, payments with secure
          information stored in the cloud, payment with check-in method, payment using

   7.2.      Mobile Advertising
   (79)      Currently, consumers typically use their mobile phones to access the same types of
             internet services as they do on their PC (such as Google and Facebook) as illustrated
             in Figure 1 below.
                                                                          79
   Figure 1– websites and internet services accessed by smartphone and PC
   (80)      According to the Notifying Parties, advertisers and advertising agencies currently
             view mobile advertising (including all forms of mobile advertising – messaging, non-
             search and search advertising) as merely a part of their digital advertising strategy.
             This reflects the fact that most existing providers of digital advertising services are
             focused on online advertising, and simply offer mobile advertising campaigns as an
             extension of their existing services. Advertisers have not yet been willing or able to
             make use of the mobile channel to reach consumers in a substantive manner (most
             have at best only allocated small experimental budgets for mobile advertising).
   (81)      The Notifying Parties submit that advertisers have been struggling to engage in
             mobile advertising. Rather, advertisers have preferred to remain with tried and tested
             methods of advertising, such as traditional media (television, newspapers, outdoor
             advertising), static internet advertising and email advertising campaigns. In contrast
             to mobile advertising, these methods of advertising all have recognised market
             structures and relatively understandable returns on investment. Further, the
             established advertising channels have a key factor in their favour: the ability to reach
             a large audience easily, without the need to obtain prior consumer consent, access to

             the mobile handset OS or the MNO consumer base. Similarly, due to the fragmented
             nature of mobile advertising at present, tracking and reporting the performance of
             mobile campaigns is significantly more complex than doing so for online campaigns.
   (82)      In 2010, advertising on mobile handsets accounted for only 2% of the overall internet
             advertising market in the United Kingdom80. The Notifying Parties submit that while
             the revenue generated from mobile advertising […]* during the course of 2010,

             from Table 281 below that advertising expenditure on mobile search advertising as
             well as mobile display advertising have grown strongly from 2010 to 2011 and
             together reached 5.5% of total online advertising expenditure in 2011. Strong growth
             is forecasted to continue with the total share of mobile advertising expenditure on
             online advertising reaching 9.5% in 2012.

   (84)      The rapid adoption of smartphones and the even faster increase in mobile internet
             usage is increasingly enabling advertisers to deliver advertisements to consumers in a
             way which does not impair their user experience82 of the mobile handset and which
             promotes numerous features for delivering targeted advertising which are built into
             smart-devices. A number of notable retailers are beginning to explore the area, the

   (85)   The increasing reach of mobile advertising has led companies to start offering
          advertising intermediation services and coupon and voucher services to advertisers
          that are specific to mobile advertising, making it easier for advertisers to use this
          channel of advertising.
   8.     THE RELEVANT MARKETS
   (86)   According to the Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market for the
          purposes of Community competition law ("the Relevant Market Notice")85, the main
          purpose of market definition is to identify in a systematic way the competitive
          constraints faced by the merging parties. In doing so, the Commission takes into
          account a range of evidence enabling it to assess the extent to which substitution
          would take place. The Commission considers the characteristics and specificity of
          the industry and products or services analysed86.
   (87)   According to the Relevant Market Notice "differences in product characteristics are
          not in themselves sufficient to exclude demand substitutability, since this will depend
          to a large extent on how customers value different characteristics"87. Thus, the fact
          that products are differentiated does not indicate whether or not they belong to
          separate product markets. What matters is the effect of those product characteristics
          on substitution patterns.
   (88)   In the present case, the operation takes place in the new but fast growing sector of
          mCommerce, which essentially encompasses mobile payments, mobile advertising
          and mobile data analytics. The fact that these sectors are nascent and evolving or
          simply not existing yet in the United Kingdom has rendered the Commission's
          investigation quite complex. In particular, the different level of knowledge by market
          participants of the technologies currently used or the lack of certainty as to the ones
          that will need to be developed, and the difference of understanding of definitions of
          terms (for example what an online mobile payment is compared to an offline mobile
          payment) has required the Commission to invest a significant amount of time in
          following up first and second phase questionnaires with a large number of telephone
          conference calls with relevant market participants.
   (89)   The relevant geographic market comprises the area in which the undertakings
          concerned are involved in the supply and demand of products or services, in which
          the conditions of competition are sufficiently homogeneous and which can be

            appreciably different in those areas88.
   8.1.     Relevant Product Markets
   8.1.1.   Market for wholesale supply of mobile wallet platforms
   8.1.1.1. The View of the Notifying Parties
   (90)     The Notifying Parties submit that the JV Co would be active in a new market for the
            wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform services in the United Kingdom. This
            market would combine the attributes of the two following existing sets of services:
            contactless physical transactions services such as services already offered by banks
            through NFC-enabled debit and credit cards (such as for instance Visa, MasterCard,
            or Barclays), and online transaction services such as those already offered by PayPal,
            Google Checkout, etc. On this market, the Notifying Parties submit that the JV Co
            services would compete with the services offered by companies already active in
            either or both of these existing markets, as well as from alternative mobile wallet
            platforms offered by OTT players such as PayPal and Google.
   8.1.1.2. The Commission's assessment
   (91)     Essentially, the JV Co is developing a platform, upon which all participating Service
            Users will develop their own mobile wallet offered to end users89. Whilst being built
            on the same technical platform, Service Users can differentiate their mobile wallets
            through different branding and design, as long as that design works with JV Co's
            platform. With regard to design, although the way in which the mobile wallet works
            will be the same (i.e. the same screens carrying the same key content will appear
            when using the mobile wallet), each Service User can differentiate their mobile
            wallets by tailoring its look and feel and by adding in their own specific services and
            functionality90. With regard to branding, any Service User (including the Notifying
            Parties) is free to enter into a specific deal with a Service Provider for the provision
            of a unique service, such as a co-branded credit or debit card, loyalty cards which
            could be combined with unique offers and vouchers not available through other
            Service Users mobile wallets and the delivery of marketing campaigns to be sent to
            end users by that Service User91.

   (92)  Most respondents to the market investigation92, even if some qualify their answers,
         agree that a wholesale level for the supply of mobile wallet platform services can be
         distinguished as a separate market or, at least, as a separate activity, from other
         activities or products, in particular offering a (branded) user interface through which
         mobile wallet services are provided to final consumers. These mobile wallet services
         would provide third parties with the capability to offer a mobile wallet to final
         consumers, without having to develop a full platform with the accompanying
         infrastructure, such as the JV Co platform.
   (93)  The market for the wholesale supply of mobile wallet platforms could operate both on a
         SIM-based SE as well as an embedded SE. Indeed, on the basis of the market
         investigation, the Commission has found that while each technology may have certain
         advantages over the other, both technologies are regarded as equally secure (see Recital
         (112)). During the market investigation, the Commission has found that several
         companies will offer or are already offering what is commonly referred to as white label
         wallets. These companies sought to provide market participants, like smaller M(V)NO,
         with the IT infrastructure for facilitating transactions, voucher redemption and data
         analytics and services, such as TSM services, to launch a branded mobile wallet, that is
         to say solutions enabling the making of a mobile wallet that could be offered to
         customer.
   (94)  Ericsson provides a software platform for electronic wallets and the handling of
         mobile financial services93. The platform is built on Ericsson's billing service. The
         functionalities of its services for mobile wallets include: payment cards, voucher
         redemption, payment of bills, and bank transfers. They also offer a product called
         mCommerce interconnect, which is a hub service to connect different wallet systems
         and value added services providers to enable interoperability and P2P real money
         interactions using mobile wallets. Ericsson can also provide related services, such as
         TSM services.
   (95)  Intelligent Environments offers digital banking services (secure on-line and mobile
         banking) to MNOs and retailers seeking to launch financial services, amongst others.
         It is also a software and app developer for the mobile wallet software located on the
         mobile handset. Intelligent Environments launched, together with O2, an O2 branded
         mobile wallet. It features inter alia a pre-loaded card for shopping. Intelligent
         Environments is also involved in the Orange branded credit card. Barclays bank acts
         in this case as the card provider94.
   (96)  Alcatel/Lucent offers solutions that allow a mobile wallet on the mobile handset to
         interact with PoS equipment including interaction via NFC technology, using cloud
         stored customer credentials and in which coupons, vouchers and other non-monetary
         content such as loyalty points can be stored95. Alcatel/Lucent has had discussions with
         payment schemes that want to provide a comprehensive solution with advertising
         services, prepaid types of payments and classic payments. Alcatel/Lucent is a solution
         provider and sells its solution to MNOs.

   (97)    Similarly, Microsoft is reported96 to have prepared the launch (date as yet unknown) of
           a wallet application. Reportedly, the Windows Phone 8 will be NFC-enabled97 and have
           a wallet application allowing payments to be made by tapping the mobile handset on a
           credit card reader, and allowing storage of credit card and membership details securely.
           Indeed, the market investigation confirmed that Microsoft98 intends to launch its own
           mobile wallet that will integrate several financial and payment instruments and
           additional services such as loyalty points, coupons and vouchers. User customisation
           will be possible with regard to graphical user interface, instruments involved and
           ways of interaction with third parties. Microsoft wants to offer an open platform that
           would both encourage app developer adoption and consumer adoption. To encourage
           developers to develop apps on Microsoft’s hub, a standard set of Application
           Programming Interface ("API"s) would be provided to them. The Microsoft wallet
           will be preloaded on all Windows Phones. Microsoft would offer its platform
           independently of the services offered by the JV Co. Microsoft is reportedly working
           with several MNOs on integrating its wallet program with them99.
   (98)    The provision of these white label mobile wallets resembles strongly the mobile wallet
           platform that the JV Co itself wants to offer to third party M(V)NOs. Even if it cannot
           always be said that a full mobile wallet solution is provided, the companies that offer
           'white label' mobile wallet services at least partly overlap with the service offered by the
           JV Co. Moreover, these companies offer these services without themselves offering a
           mobile wallet to end-consumers that is to say they would also only be present at the
           wholesale level like the JV Co.
   (99)    This supports the finding that a market for wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform
           services exists as several companies, including the JV Co, seek to provide these
           services to third parties on a stand-alone basis. Moreover, as these companies, like the
           JV Co, are not vertically integrated into the provision of retail distribution of mobile
           wallet services to customers, the supply side of such a market would be materially
           different from the provision of retail distribution of mobile wallet services to customers.
   (100)   One respondent100, even though it acknowledged that a market for the wholesale
           supply of mobile wallet platform services and a retail market for the retail distribution
           of mobile wallet services to customers can be distinguished, noted that uncertainty
           existed as to precisely where the boundary between these markets would be set. In
           particular, because the JV Co's wholesale services may provide constraints to users to
           shape their retail services, this may blur the distinction between retail and wholesale
           level. Another respondent101, whilst recognising that the JV Co’s activities would
           clearly have a wholesale dimension, stressed that the retail level would not remain
           unaffected as the JV Co would leave very little, if any, scope for competition at retail
           level.

   (101)    The Commission agrees that some uncertainties as to the precise boundary between
            the wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform services and retail distribution of
            mobile wallet services may exist. The Commission equally recognises that vertical
            links between these markets exist. Indeed, the foreclosure risk that may result from
            these vertical links is investigated in-depth in the present Decision (see below in section
            9.2). However, the mere fact that the boundaries between these markets may not be
            defined precisely or that vertical relationships between them may exist cannot
            contradict the finding of a relevant market for the wholesale supply of mobile wallet
            platform services distinct from a market for the retail distribution of mobile wallet
            services to customers.
   (102)    The Commission takes the view that a relevant market could be defined for wholesale
            supply of mobile wallet platforms, distinct from the market for the retail distribution of
            mobile wallet services to customers. However, for the purpose of this Decision, this can
            be left open as the operation would not significantly impede effective competition
            under any alternative product market definition.
   8.1.2.   Market for secure storage
   8.1.2.1. The View of the Notifying Parties
   (103)    The Notifying Parties, in the Form CO, did not consider a market for secure storage.
   8.1.2.2. The Commission's assessment
   (104)    One respondent to the market investigation102, whilst agreeing that a wholesale level for
            the supply of mobile wallet platform services can be distinguished, considered that in
            addition, a market for access to SIM-based SEs would exist. This distinction
            corresponds to the alternative mobile wallets that may be offered by third parties to end
            users. For example, a retail mobile wallet supplier may either seek to supply a branded
            mobile wallet using the JV Co's platform, requiring the supply by the JV Co of the
            integrated wholesale mobile wallet service provided by the JV Co, or offer a mobile
            wallet based on an alternative platform than that of the JV Co, only requiring access to
            the JV Co controlled SIM-based SE to store, for instance, payment credentials.
   (105)    A mobile wallet requires secure storage of information, in particular payment
            credentials. As was already explained in Recital (54), such storage can, in principle,
            be provided by a variety of means such as storage in the cloud and storage on an SE
            which can be located in various places in or on the mobile handset.
   (106)    Irrespective of where the SE is located (in the SIM card or embedded in the hardware
            of the mobile handset), control over the access to the SE is attributed to the issuer of
            the SE (for example the M(V)NOs for SIM-based SEs). Each of these issuers can
            thus be seen as a supplier on a market for secure storage. The demand side of such a
            market would consist of retail and wholesale suppliers of wallet solutions103 (and
            possibly other suppliers of mobile handset-based apps requiring secure storage).

   (107)  The market investigation revealed that the renting of space on SEs for providers of apps
          that want to store sensitive information required for the functioning of their apps could
          be a source of revenue to those parties controlling access to the SE, regardless of where
          the SE is located (for example on the SIM or embedded). […]*104.
   (108)  It is pertinent to the present case that control over SIM-based SEs is exercised by
          their issuers: the M(V)NOs105, including the Notifying Parties. In order to assess to
          what extent competitive pressure is exercised on the Notifying Parties in a market for
          the provision of SE space, it is necessary to establish whether means for secure
          storage exist that constitute a viable substitute for SIM-based secure storage, that is
          to say whether the relevant product market for the provision of space on SEs
          comprises SEs located elsewhere as well as other means of secure storage such as
          cloud-based secure storage.
   (109)  The Notifying Parties explain that, while it is possible that security can be provided
          via software and cloud storage rather than hardware on or in the mobile handset, they
          are not aware of any specific examples that are under development106. The market
          investigation showed that, although it is in principle possible that transactions made
          from a mobile handset could be completed via solutions which would not use an SE,
          that is to say through software secure solutions where the payment credentials would
          be stored in the cloud, such solutions are generally considered less secure or too slow
          to be used at the point of sale as they require entering usernames and passwords107.
          On this point, one competitor108 explained that it "is possible for customers to
          complete transactions from a mobile phone via means other than through a SE. This
          is the case for so-called card-not-present transactions. However, such transactions
          are generally considered less secure, and therefore will typically incur a greater cost
          for merchants (e.g., 2% fee without a SE compared to a 1% fee for a transaction
          completed through a SE). Card-not-present transactions may also require users to
          input their payment information (card number, expiry date, etc.) for each individual
          transaction, which may render this option less attractive to users seeking the speed
          and convenience of card-present transactions".
   (110)  It was also found in the market investigation that using additional hardware that
          contains an SE attached to the mobile handset is considered a somewhat less
          attractive alternative because it would be expensive, the costs would be unlikely to
          be borne by consumers, consumers would have to be convinced to attach additional
          hardware to their mobile handset, and no standards seem to exist for the interfaces
          between such additional hardware and mobile handsets109. The market investigation
          among potential customers of the JV Co confirmed that the possibility of attaching
          additional hardware to the mobile handset would not be seen as an attractive option110.

   (111)  It appears therefore that cloud-based secure storage and additional hardware containing
          SEs attached to the mobile handset are not perfect substitutes for SIM-based SEs.
   (112)  However, SEs embedded in a mobile handset have shown to be a close substitute for a
          SIM-based SE. Whereas using a SIM-based SE may confer some advantages for
          payment related application, such as portability between different mobile handsets or
          the ability to block a wallet if a mobile handset is lost or stolen, embedded SEs may
          be suited better for other types of apps, such as access control111. However, this
          cannot distract from the fact that both types of SEs are suited to provide secure
          storage for mobile wallets and other apps. Indeed, security requirements are the same
          for both a SIM-SE as well as for an embedded SE112 and both types of SEs are
          generally also perceived as equally secure113. The choice between the two types of
          SEs is therefore not based on technical advantages of one type over another.
   (113)  It appears that the use of SIM-based SEs is for the time being technically more
          standardized than the use of embedded and external SEs. However, this
          standardization was merely more necessary for SIM-based SEs in order to ensure
          portability of SIM-based SE between different mobile handsets (that may have
          different technical characteristics). This same issue of portability of SIM-based SEs
          does not exist with an embedded SE as it is part of the hardware of the mobile
          handset but hence cannot be moved between different mobile handsets114.
   (114)  A SIM-based SE as well as an embedded SE can co-exist on a mobile handset and a
          significant number of mobile handsets contain both an embedded and SIM-based
          SE115 (See also Recital (267)). This increases the degree of substitutability between
          SIM-based and embedded SEs as it implies that retail suppliers of mobile wallet
          services to customers can reach similar groups of users regardless of whether they
          contract with a suppliers of secure storage on a SIM-based SE or an embedded SE.
   (115)  As regards the user experience / end-users' ease-of-use of mobile wallets, current
          technology allows for several methods of coexistence of SIM-based and embedded
          based secure storage on a single mobile handset. One example is through user
          selection of the default SE whereby the user could be presented with the option to
          switch the default SE. Another option, referred to as Technology Routing, would
          allow certain types of NFC traffic to be automatically routed to either the embedded
          SE or the SIM-based SE without impact to user experience116. These options further
          illustrate that embedded and SIM-based SEs provide essentially the same
          functionality for a mobile handset user and provider of wallet services alike.
          Moreover, it appears that an end-user could even be unaware as to what type of
          secure storage is actually used by the wallet application on its mobile handset.
   (116)  On the basis of the above, the Commission does not exclude that a distinction could
          be made between a market for wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform services

            and a market for the provision of secure storage only. However, a market for the
            provision of secure storage would not only comprise the provision of secure storage
            on SIM cards but at least also include secure storage provided on embedded SEs and,
            possibly, on SEs on devices attached to the mobile handset and cloud-based
            solutions.
   (117)    In any event, for the purpose of the present Decision it can be left open whether a
            market for secure storage comprises also secure storage on SEs on devices attached
            to the handset or cloud-based solutions since the operation would not significantly
            impede effective competition under any alternative product market definition.
   8.1.3.   Market for retail distribution of mobile wallets services to customers
   8.1.3.1. The View of the Notifying Parties
   (118)    The Notifying Parties117 consider that a downstream market for the retail distribution
            of mobile wallets services to customers exists. The JV Co itself will not be present in
            this market. Instead, the JV Co's offer of a wholesale supply of mobile wallet
            platforms will enable the Notifying Parties, other participating M(V)NOs and other
            participating Service Users to offer an individualised mobile wallet for retail on the
            basis of the underlying mobile wallet platform provided by the JV Co.
   (119)    All Service Users will be able to differentiate their mobile wallets offered at the retail
            level through branding and the design of the mobile wallets, as long as that design
            works with the JV Co's platform. The Notifying Parties consider that they will remain
            in competition at the retail level for the provision of mobile wallet services to
            consumers.
   (120)    From a consumer's perspective, the key feature of any mobile wallet will be the
            availability of a variety of payment and other transactions services, which are
            accepted in a large number of PoS. The Notifying Parties consider that the mobile
            wallets offered at retail level, using the JV Co's platform, will be viable substitutes
            for the following:
            (a)    Physical, off-line payment services and other transactions services; and
            (b)    Online payment services and other transactions services.
   (121)    All Service Users would compete with each other at the retail level in relation to
            these services and with companies that are already established in the provision of
            physical offline or online payments. With regard to physical transactions, the
            Notifying Parties consider that vertically integrated international players such as
            Google and PayPal, banks, and other companies offering forms of contactless
            transactions constitute competitive constraints. With regard to online transactions, all
            Service Users are considered to compete with each other and with established online
            payment players, including PayPal, Google, Amazon, and Apple (iTunes).
   (122)    Hence, the Notifying Parties consider that the market for retail distribution of mobile
            wallets to consumers is part of a wider market including physical and online

            transaction services. The physical transaction services would comprise mobile
            contactless payments as well as other means of settling payment offline including
            NFC-enabled credit and debit cards and traditional means of payment, such as cash.
            The online transaction services would comprise both online payments made using
            mobile handsets as well as other forms of online payments made on static devices
            (such as desktop PCs).
   (123)    With regard to physical transactions, the Notifying Parties consider that the
            narrowest plausible relevant market is the market for mobile contactless or off-line
            payments118. With regard to online transactions, the Notifying Parties consider that
            the narrowest plausible relevant market is the market for online payments made
            using mobile handsets119.
   8.1.3.2. The Commission's assessment
   (124)    During the market investigation, the Commission assessed in particular the
            following:
            (a)    Whether the retail market for the provision of mobile wallet services (including
                   both offline and online mobile payments) would constitute a separate market
                   from existing online payment services (through credit/debit cards/ PayPal etc,
                   via the internet on a static PC, tablet, or on a mobile handset);
            (b)    Whether the retail market for the provision of mobile wallet services (including
                   both offline and online mobile payments) would constitute a separate market
                   from existing offline payment (NFC-enabled credit and debit cards, and
                   traditional means of payment such as credit, debit cards and cash);
            (c)    Whether the retail market for the provision of mobile wallet services should be
                   further subdivided between offline and online mobile payments.
   Mobile payments versus existing online payments
   (125)    Regarding the substitution of mobile-based payment systems with existing online
            payment systems, overall, a majority of respondents considered that mobile
            payments are not (yet) substitutable with existing online payment systems.120
   (126)    For instance, according to one respondent, "[a]t present there are few, if any,
            examples of these two payment types substituting for each other in the UK at the
            point of sale. In future however this may be possible"121. Another respondent122
            considered such substitution to be unlikely because an online transaction is still a
            lengthy process which significantly increases the transaction time. This was
            attributed to the lengthy process of data entry and authentication processes which are
            unlikely to be practical, reliable in operation and unlikely to reach a level of
            uniformity to constitute a proper replacement. Furthermore, an Internet (3G or Wi-

           everybody and at all locations yet.
   (127)  The Commission considers that currently existing methods of online payments and
           mobile payments may belong to different relevant product markets. However, for the
           purpose of the present Decision it can be left open whether currently existing
           methods of online payment are part of the same market as methods of mobile
           payment as the operation would not significantly impede effective competition under
           any alternative product market definition.
   Mobile payments versus existing offline payment
   (128)  When asked about the substitutability of mobile based payment systems with
           currently existing NFC-based offline payment systems (for example NFC-based
           credit cards), some respondents stated that, although the primary functions of NFC-
           enabled cards and NFC m-payments are the same (transaction processing)123, some
           additional features would be different. In particular, NFC-based mobile technology
           would be more convenient, offer the advantage of consolidating the credit and debit
           credentials into a single contact device with the security and convenience inherent in
           the single-mobile handset. This would result in a different user experience (in terms
           of convenience and ease of use) for end-users124 and offline NFC-based mobile
           technology would offer important ancillary services such as voucher redemption,
           which would enhance the consumer experience (in terms of additional services being
           offered to end-users)125.
   (129)  One market participant took the view that there would not be "a significant difference
           in how payments are processed from either the mobile phone or currently existing
           NFC enabled models, since both methods are backed by the same credit/debit
           credentials with the primary difference being the method by which those credentials
           are transferred at the Point of Sale. Once the transaction is initiated at the point of
           sale, the processing of the payments through the card issuers and banks can proceed
           along the existing "rails" of the payment networks"126.
   (130)  Mobile payments and NFC-enabled cards appear comparable for the time being to
           the traditional ways of payment only insofar as they concern transaction processing
           for smaller payment amounts127. The offline credit and debit cards are a convenient
           method of payment, which is widely used and accepted in the United Kingdom.
           However they lack a number of the benefits of mobile payments such as voucher
           redemption possibilities.
   (131)  Some respondents stated that different means of making payments (credit and debit
           cards and cash) will continue to co-exist and are complementary rather than
           interchangeable. Indeed, according to one financial institution128, studies have shown
           that customers would like both mobile payment methods and existing off-line

          payment in the foreseeable future. It clarified that, even if the trend is clearly going
          to be towards increased consumer demand to execute payments via mobile handsets,
          consumers nonetheless expect and demand to be able to pick and choose from a
          range of different payment mechanisms (cash, card, mobile, online, offline, etc.).
   (132)  Payment card issuers stressed that, because consumers expect and demand to be able
          to pick and choose from a range of different payment mechanisms payment card
          issuers will also want to offer a variety of types of payment services in order to win,
          retain and satisfy customers129.
   (133)  Regarding the substitution between mobile handset based systems with currently
          existing offline payment systems (cash, credit and debit cards), the market
          investigation pointed at different orientations130. On one hand, the view was taken
          that high costs for payments through NFC-enabled mobile handsets would mean that
          their introduction would be hampered or even that it would cause their replacement
          by different payment systems (including cash, credit/debit cards and NFC-enabled
          cards) by both retailers and customers131. This suggests that existing form of
          payments may exert competitive pressure on mobile wallets. Some big retailers
          replied that they "could revert to currently existing offline payments if mPayments
          became more costly to use but this decision would ultimately be customer driven. If
          customers want to use mPayments and our competitors are offering them then we
          would be at a competitive disadvantage if we did not offer mPayments to our
          customers"132. Another response stated however that the proportion of consumers
          still preferring to use offline payments will be more demographic and age-driven133.
   (134)  One respondent134, whereas it stressed that NFC payment will be the simplest,
          speediest and most secure mode of mobile payment, considered that the market for
          mobile payment is technologically much broader that what is typically understood by
          NFC and online payments and would include the PayPal dongle (a device that turns a
          smartphone into a credit card terminal) and Barclay's PayTag (stick-on credit card),
          which may help educate customers about mobile payments. At this moment, it is not
          yet possible to predict which innovation will become the common form of payment
          of the future.
   (135)  Therefore, the Commission considers that mobile payments are likely to continue to
          coexist in the foreseeable future with non-mobile means of payment including NFC
          and non NFC-enabled credit and debit cards. Consumers will want to continue using
          several means of payment and suppliers of means of payment and retailers have an
          incentive to continue to supply and accept means of payment used by their
          customers. Even if these means of payments have characteristics that distinguish
          them from mobile payments, a certain degree of substitutability is most likely to
          exist, most notably between mobile payments and NFC-enabled credit and debit
          cards, implying that currently existing means of off-line payment may exert

           competitive pressure on retail suppliers of mobile payment services. This will in turn
           create an indirect competitive constraint on wholesale suppliers of mobile wallet
           platforms. However, for the purpose of the present Decision, it can be left open
           whether currently offline payments are part of the same market as mobile payments
           since the operation would not significantly impede effective competition under any
           alternative product market definition.
   Online and offline mobile payments
   (136)   The market investigation highlighted that there is the potential that online mobile
           payment would be different from NFC-based offline mobile payment from a user
           experience perspective135. A majority of respondents136 did not consider them to be
           interchangeable for consumers, at least not at present. The main differentiating factors
           were: limited 3G coverage, different user experience, security conditions, infrastructure
           requirements and functionalities137. For instance, one respondent138 stressed that off-
           line NFC payments and online payments with a mobile handset have different
           purposes at present as well as most likely in the future and that the customer journey
           is different.
   (137)   In terms of acceptance by merchants, one respondent specified that "[a]t present,
           mobile contactless and online payments via a phone data connection are not
           interchangeable for UK merchants, in that there is little or no overlap in the
           acceptance of contactless and the acceptance of mobile payments via 3g/wifi. In
           future, these payments may become more interchangeable in environments where
           transaction speed is not critical, for example paying a restaurant bill. By contrast,
           where payment speed is important offline contactless mobile payments will continue
           to have a significant advantage"139.
   (138)   As regards supply side substitutability for card issuers (whether banks, transport
           operators or others) the majority of respondents140 consider that the two mobile
           payment services are not substitutable, but rather complementary, at least for the
           moment.
   (139)   Therefore, the Commission considers that online and offline mobile payments are not
           likely to be part of the same relevant product market at least at present. While the
           evolution in the short to medium term is not entirely clear141, for the present Decision

   The View of the Notifying Parties
   (143)    According to the Notifying Parties the relevant product market for the assessment of
            the formation of the JV Co is the market for the supply of intermediation services for
            digital advertising in the United Kingdom, including all forms of digital advertising
            (whether marketing messaging via email, SMS or push notification; or search and
            non-search online advertising), delivered both through static internet connections and
            through mobile communications devices (and indeed through intermediate devices
            such as laptops and tablet computers).

   (144)  The Notifying Parties consider that from the demand-side perspective, there is
          substitutability between mobile advertising and digital advertising generally, between
          targeted marketing messaging and web-based advertising and between targeted SMS
          messaging and other forms of targeted marketing messaging142.
   (145)  The Notifying Parties submit that there are no unique attributes of advertising
          through mobile handsets which would prevent advertisers from quickly and easily
          switching their campaigns back to traditional online formats. Very few websites
          currently distinguish between viewing through a mobile handset as opposed to a
          static PC. For example, as location information is already widely available (and will
          become even more so with the adoption of the new HTML5 standard143), the
          Notifying Parties consider that location-based information is simply one input into
          the ever-increasing targeting capability of advertising , which does not in and of
          itself add a unique attribute to any given advertising service.
   (146)  Furthermore, the Notifying Parties submit that it would be appropriate to consider
          targeted marketing messaging services (whether SMS, MMS, email or IP push
          notifications) in the same way as search and display advertising: namely as a format
          for advertisers to utilise in order to reach their desired consumer audience144.
          Although messaging has some distinct features from online display advertising in
          terms of the way that the advert is delivered, both forms of advertising have similar
          targeting capabilities, and both are based on data collected on their interests through
          consumers' previous behaviours. This targeting capability now rivals the information
          revealed about a consumer's interests in a search advertising context145. Furthermore,
          all forms of advertising services offered by the JV Co may serve the same purposes,
          for example a direct response advertisement or a brand awareness advertisement. The
          increased ability to target non-search advertising now allows direct response
          advertisements to be presented as display ads (whether online, in-app or through
          messaging) to the consumers most likely to take action146. Also, due to the format of
          mobile handsets, the distinguishing features of the different forms of advertising are
          less pronounced than in the static online world147.
   (147)  The Notifying Parties also submit that the JV Co would send targeted marketing
          messages to mobile subscribers that have opted in to receive such messages. A
          distinction could be made between push SMS (opted-in customers in the JV Co's
          database) and intelligent bulk SMS (opted-in customers in advertisers' databases).
          The Notifying Parties however also submit that within active marketing messaging,
          in practice IP push notifications do not substantially differ from traditional push SMS
          messages148. IP-based push notifications can be delivered to all smartphones through
          apps downloaded to a consumer's handset. These are internet-protocol based
          notifications which allow the application to make a message appear on a consumer's
          handset. On many smartphones, these notifications take exactly the same form as the
          notification of the receipt of an SMS, regardless of the type of connectivity (2G, 3G

           or Wi-Fi). As regards email messaging, the Notifying Parties submit that it is
           substitutable with push SMS, in particular because of the increased market
           penetration of smartphones, which means that many (and soon to be most)
           consumers have access to their email accounts on their mobile handsets. Email
           messages can appear in the inbox of a smartphone user via a notification in the same
           way as an SMS149.
   (148)   On the supply-side, the Notifying Parties submit that there is a considerable and
           growing competitive threat from online advertising intermediaries such as Google or
           Apple who are moving into mobile advertising intermediation and who have access
           to key inputs into a digital advertising business – location data and browsing data150.
   (149)   The Notifying Parties submit that there will be a number of supply-side competitive
           constraints which the JV Co will have to face in the provision of mobile advertising
           intermediation services. These can be any of the following:
           (a)    the ability of publishers to switch between different forms of inventory and
                  how they choose to sell it (they may choose to develop static online inventory
                  rather than mobile inventory) or they may also sell directly to advertisers
                  themselves, either exclusively or in conjunction with the use of an advertising
                  network;
           (b)    the ability of static online advertising intermediaries to provide mobile
                  advertising intermediation services, which they are well placed to do, and are
                  increasingly doing, as the relationships they have with publishers and
                  advertisers will, in many cases, be the same for mobile inventory as for static
                  online inventory. Furthermore, much of the skills and technology required for
                  static online intermediation services are the same as those required for
                  intermediation of mobile advertising inventory;
           (c)    the ability of publishers that sell directly to advertisers to choose to
                  intermediate. In particular, where a publisher has particularly rich targeting
                  information, then it may well be commercially attractive for it to monetise this
                  data.
   (150)   Therefore, the Notifying Parties conclude that all forms of digital inventory are to be
           regarded as substitutable and the relevant market should not be further sub-
           segmented.
   The Commission's assessment
   Online and mobile advertising
   (151)   In its previous practice, the Commission has distinguished between the provision of
           online and offline advertising space151. The Commission also discussed the question
           of whether the market for online advertising could be subsegmented into search and

          non-search services but finally left this question open, because under any alternative
          product market definition, the transaction did not raise any competition concerns152.
   (152)  The Commission also looked into a possible sub-market for mobile (search)
          advertising153. The Commission explained that mobile advertising, which presents
          some distinguishing features both technically (e.g; size of the ads) and commercially
          (for example it is especially appropriate to advertise outlets near to the actual
          location of the holder of the smartphone) is one of the most important recent
          developments in online advertising, but left open whether it would already constitute
          a separate product market154.
   (153)  The vast majority of respondents to the market investigation considers that the
          mobile advertising services include many different offers: search ads on web-pages
          accessible via mobile; non-search ads (for example web banners) on webpages
          accessible via mobile handsets; SMS ads (including intelligent bulk SMS); MMS
          ads; email ads accessible via mobile; in-app ads; push messages (including IP-based
          push notifications, i.e. for coupons and vouchers); pull messages (including coupons
          and vouchers)155.
   (154)  A majority of the respondents to the market investigation considered that it is not
          possible to substitute online static advertising accessed through (desktop or laptop)
          computers with advertising accessed on a mobile handset such as a smartphone and
          to some extent a tablet156.
   (155)  The Commission notes that the border in terms of screen size or other properties
          between modern desktop computers, laptops, tablets and even smartphones is
          becoming increasingly blurred. However, a distinction still has to be made between
          their regular usage, the OS, special apps and websites accessed on a desktop or
          laptop computer on one hand, and those especially developed for a tablet or a
          smartphone on the other hand.
   (156)  Some respondents commented that mobile and online advertising are
          complementary. One respondent argued that "given customers' behaviour and
          proliferation of internet-enabled devices this usage is incremental rather than
          cannibalistic"157. Another respondent agreed, saying that it sees "both channels
          working side by side"158. Some of the reasons for finding that mobile and online
          advertising are not substitutable relate to the size of the screen, the fact that mobile

           handsets' penetration is not yet 100%, the reliability and speed of 3G connection on
           mobile handsets and the different type of consumer experience.
   (157)   However, the majority of the respondents expect the markets to converge in the
           future. Some commented on the fact that mobile advertising is still constantly
           evolving. One respondent159 stated that "the mobile advertising strategy has not been
           defined yet". Some of the reasons increasing the likelihood of convergence are the
           widespread use of smartphones and the increasing popularity of tablets as well as the
           adoption of the HTML 5 standard. Another respondent160 stated that consumer
           behaviour would change to accept information from smaller screens, tablets etc.
           Through the use of tablets, people are moving away from static desktop computing.
           One respondent161 even predicted that "eventually static online display advertising
           would disappear".
   (158)   On this basis, it appears that mobile and online advertising currently present to a
           large extent different features, which difference may diminish at some point in the
           future. However, it is not clear whether and, if so, when and to what extent this
           convergence would take place.
   (159)   For the purposes of the present Decision, it can however be left open if mobile
           advertising constitutes a separate market from online (search or non-search) advertising
           or if it is part of a broader market, since the operation is not likely to lead to a
           significant impediment of effective competition under any possible product market
           definition.
   Targeted marketing messaging within mobile advertising
   (160)   The large majority of respondents to the market investigation considered that within
           mobile advertising, targeted marketing messaging (including SMS/MMS, intelligent
           bulk SMS, bulk SMS and IP-based push messages162) constitutes a separate market
           from search and non-search mobile advertising. The two services are seen as being
           complementary and not substitutable163.
   (161)   The main reasons for the lack of substitutability are their different approaches,
           marketing scope and reach, campaign objectives, functions of the means of
           advertising, pricing models, targeting possibilities, consumer data collection and
           consumer behaviour. These are some of the reasons why active marketing messaging is
           used in parallel to other types of mobile advertising, as a part of a bundle of different
           advertising techniques within a given advertising campaign with regard to which the
           two are substitutable only to a limited extent.
   (162)   For example, targeted marketing messaging is perceived as allowing advertisers to
           capture consumer engagement, providing feedback and timproving the targeting of

          The Commission acknowledges that there are also other forms of targeted messaging, such as search or
          content targeted advertising. The term "targeted market messaging" in the present Decision however
          does not include refer to them, since they are not directly relevant for the competition assessment.

           advertisement164. It would be possible (given the capability from a data warehousing
           and advertising or push targeting perspective) to target the right audience using both
           types of advertising. However, there are various differences mainly based on
           demographics, account holdings, behaviour etc165. Furthermore, according to another
           respondent, advertising publishers that do not offer push marketing but do offer for
           example mobile display advertising would need to develop a customer service
           around an opted-in database, which would be costly and would require a special sales
           team166.
   (163)   The Commission therefore considers that targeted marketing messaging presents a
           number of differences, which often render it not substitutable to search or non-search
           mobile advertising.
   (164)   In addition, advertising linked to NFC technology (for example tapping a mobile
           handset on a poster to obtain a voucher) would be distinct from mobile messaging, as
           the former requires active engagement of the consumer and is rather a form of
           untargeted advertising.
   (165)   For the purposes of the present Decision, it can however be left open whether mobile
           marketing messaging constitutes a separate market from search and non-search mobile
           advertising or if it is part of a broader market, since the operation is not likely to lead to
           a significant impediment of effective competition under any possible product market
           definition.
   Existence of separate sub-markets within targeted marketing messaging
   (166)   The Commission also assessed whether within targeted marketing messaging, push
           SMS and intelligent bulk SMS on one hand, and IP push notifications on the other
           hand, would constitute separate markets.
   (167)   Three UK argues that within active mobile messaging there is a separate market for
           push advertising via SMS or MMS, on which the JV Co would be very strong.
   (168)   According to Three UK, advertisers and media agencies do not consider mobile push
           advertising (mobile messaging via SMS and MMS) and the associated subscriber data
           closely substitutable with other forms of advertising. Mobile push advertising would
           have unique features which allow advertisers to provide campaigns which: are highly
           targeted to the users, can elicit an immediate customer response, can allow the
           advertiser to accurately measure campaign success and consumer engagement, and are
           very attractive to the user, since offers are clipped to the wallet, can be redeemed
           simultaneously with payment and can be managed together with other cards and offers
           via a single wallet app167. The Commission considers that, from the consumer's
           perspective, IP push notifications can have similar characteristics to a push SMS and
           intelligent bulk SMS. Provided the device has the application installed and the
           necessary permissions enabled on the application, the message can be functionally the

          same as an SMS. However, IP push notifications can be turned off by a consumer via
          the settings in their User Interface or within the application.
   (169)  A number of other alternatives to SMS are now emerging, operating through the data
          connection of a smartphone ( through the internet). For example, on its iOS5, Apple has
          enabled the iMessage service. This is a free messaging service which uses the data
          connection of iPhones and iPads to send messages that appear identical from a user's
          perspective to an SMS.
   (170)  Whereas the majority of respondents to the market investigation replied that the various
          types of targeted marketing messaging would not substitute each other, only few
          provided a detailed explanation of their answer. Some respondents explained that the
          different types are likely to coexist168 and that there are a number of differences in terms
          of capabilities, cost structures, pricing and availability on devices169 and that the type of
          message depends on the ad campaign's aim. Also, advertising intermediaries who
          currently sell SMS consider that it may not be easy to switch to IP push notification170.
          One respondent submitted that “IP push notifications are at least one sixth of the cost of
          simple bulk SMS, and in fact very large volume push notifications are even cheaper. In
          other words the market conditions would not be impacted by variances of 5% to 10%.
          In addition, IP Push notifications allow richer content than SMS, especially when
          delivered to smartphones and so they can be more valuable to consumers”171.
   (171)  However, most of the market participants who provided a reasoned response and most
          advertisers considered that push or intelligent bulk SMS and IP push notifications are
          substitutable in particular because SMS and IP push notifications have comparable
          qualities and usage and that many advertisers would use IP push notifications instead of
          SMS in order to reach the same audience since the former are at close to zero cost. For
          example, one respondent submitted that "[t]he key difference between SMS and IP push
          message is the cost model […] There may be a small amount of up-front production
          cost to the advertisers in the build stage of applications/sites to enable push
          notifications but this is likely to be minimal. The difference in effort between
          management and monitoring of IP based messaging and SMS/MMS messaging is
          minimal"172. Other respondents replied that the campaign objectives are the same173 and
          that IP push notifications would replace SMS to a significant extent if widely
          available174 since it offers zero cost options175 for advertisers. One advertiser explained
          that "IM [internet messaging] and in-app messaging will begin to replace SMS/MMS
          marketing messages in the near future and at a greatly reduced cost. Handset
          manufacturers are already beginning to deliver this capability, bypassing the mobile
          networks"176. According to one competitor, "SMS and IP push messages are very

            differ in the scope of what they can do"177.
   (172)    Indeed, push or intelligent bulk SMS and IP push notifications in particular tend to
            fulfil similar objectives and can be substituted without incurring significant costs.
            Both push and intelligent bulk SMS and IP push notifications are highly targetable,
            can prompt immediate customer response, and are likely to be attractive to end
            customers (for instance by being clipped to the mobile wallet).178 While certain
            differences between the various types of targeted mobile messaging still exist, these
            differences are likely to decrease in the future with the increasing penetration and use
            of internet connected mobile devices and mobile applications. SMS was even
            considered by some respondents to the market investigation as a support, which
            progressively looses weight in the market179. For example, one respondent submitted
            that "[i]n the longer run SMS will be replaced by IP messaging as IP messaging, as
            opposed to SMS, is free. Aegis has no concerns regarding the effect of the
            transaction on the markets for mobile advertising and data analytics services and on
            the bulk SMS market. The importance of the latter market will decline as IP
            messaging becomes more attractive. The JV would enhance the growth of the mobile
            advertising market, which is welcomed by Aegis."180
   (173)    In view of the above, the Commission considers that despite certain differences
            between the various types of targeted mobile messaging, in particular push or
            intelligent bulk SMS and IP push notifications may become part of the same market.
            However, for the purposes of the present Decision, it can be left open if the different
            types of targeted mobile marketing messages constitute separate markets or are part of a
            broader market, as the operation is not likely to lead to a significant impediment of
            effective competition under any possible product market definition.
   Intermediation of mobile advertising versus direct sales
   (174)    The JV Co will be an intermediary for targeted marketing messaging, non-search and
            other forms of advertising on mobile handsets (such as coupons and vouchers).
   (175)    In its previous practice181 the Commission has defined a separate market for
            intermediation in online advertising in view of the fact that direct sales are no
            substitute for the service provided by intermediaries for the sale of smaller
            publishers' inventory and for the sale of (at least) part of the remnant inventory of
            larger publishers that also use the direct sales channel. In addition, the Commission
            acknowledged that "ad networks are currently developing sales models that are
            progressively becoming very close to the direct sales channels", but the Commission
            concluded that "these developments are still at a very initial stage and cannot be
            considered to be an established market trend"182. The Commission also left open

          For advertisers, both means would also allow data analytics services, in order for instance to determine
          the degree of success of a campaign.
   179
          This would be due in particular to the technical restrictions applying to SMS (limitation in size, etc.).

          whether a further sub-division of this market in search and non-search intermediation
          is necessary183.
   (176)  The present market investigation did not allow an unambiguous conclusion to be
          drawn on a possible separation of the markets into sales of mobile advertising space
          through intermediaries and direct sales.
   (177)  A majority of the customers of mobile advertising replied that the prices of inventory
          sold directly by publishers are not comparable to those sold via intermediaries184,
          however, without providing any detailed explanation. One respondent explained for
          instance that "generally intermediaries deal with remnant inventory, thus it is
          cheaper"185. Another respondent submitted that the "vast majority of mobile media is
          sold via a mobile network and /or specialist mobile sales house"186.
   (178)  Nevertheless, a majority of respondents on the supply side confirmed that direct sales
          compete with intermediaries in mobile display advertising, particularly with regard to
          prices187. One respondent explained that "[t]hese compete because advertisers have
          finite marketing budgets and the direct sales will be competing with intermediation
          sales for the same marketing budget regardless of the form of advertising"188.
          Another submitted that "mobile intermediaries provide significant competition to
          direct sales of mobile advertising, particularly with regard to price and this has been
          a contributory factor in driving down the price of mobile advertising
          significantly"189.
   (179)  Another respondent stated: "At times, developers and advertisers purchase and sell
          mobile advertising directly from each other. Large app developers with a substantial
          mobile advertising businesses, may decide to directly monetize some or all of their
          advertising space without utilizing the services of a mobile advertising intermediary.
          This type of direct advertising sales make it more difficult for mobile advertising
          intermediaries and could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit
          margins, increased sales and marketing expenses or the loss of market share for
          mobile advertising intermediaries"190.
   (180)  According to another respondent, "[…] direct sales of mobile advertising inventory
          compete with indirect sales of mobile advertising inventory, although […] indirect
          sales account for a significant proportion of the market. Accordingly, while indirect
          sales are a significant constraint on direct sales (and in respect of mobile
          advertising, the presence of mobile intermediaries has been a contributory factor in
          driving down the price of mobile advertising significantly), the more limited presence
          of direct sales minimises the ability of direct sales to constrain indirect sales in the
          same way"191.

   (181)    Therefore, direct sales of mobile advertising constrain the sale of mobile advertising
            through intermediaries to a significant extent. In any event, for the purposes of the
            present Decision, it can be left open whether there are separate markets for direct and
            intermediated sales of mobile advertising or whether they are part of a broader market,
            as the operation is not likely to lead to a significant impediment of effective competition
            under any possible product market definition.
   Overall Conclusion
   (182)    On the basis of the above, it is concluded that, as regards the JV Co's advertising
            activities, the precise product market definition can be left open, as the operation
            would not significantly impede effective competition under any alternative product
            market definition.
   8.1.5.   Market for retail and wholesale bulk SMS services
   (183)    Retail bulk SMS is a service that enables businesses (such as retailers or financial
            institutions) to send high volumes of text messages to their customers (provided that
            these have opted in to receive such messages on their mobile handsets). It can be
            used for sending marketing messages but is currently mainly used for general
            customer communications. For example a bank might use a retail bulk SMS service
            to send mini-bank statements or fraud alerts to its customers.
   (184)    Delivery of messages via SMS to their intended recipients requires connectivity into
            one or more mobile networks and the physical conveyance of those messages to the
            relevant mobile subscribers. This service is referred to as the wholesale delivery of
            bulk SMS. The service consists of two main elements: firstly, conveyance of the
            message from the sender (the JV Co or an aggregator to the mobile network to which
            the intended recipient has subscribed (the home network) and secondly, conveyance
            by the home network to the recipient's mobile handset.
   8.1.5.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (185)    The Notifying Parties consider that there is a separate market for retail bulk SMS
            services and for wholesale bulk SMS delivery services, which is an upstream input
            into the marketing messaging services of the JV Co192
   (186)    The Notifying Parties consider that retail bulk SMS is distinguishable from the other
            services to be provided by the JV Co and is likely to constitute a separate relevant
            market because it is often used in a different way from advertising services. In
            particular, it is commonly used for direct communications between companies and
            customers that have opted in to receive such information. It also lacks the essential
            feature of targeting or intelligence that characterises the other services to be provided
            by the JV Co as part of its marketing services. Furthermore, it is an existing service
            with a large pool of established players who will pose a direct competitive constraint
            on the JV Co.

   8.1.5.2. The Commission's assessment
   (187)     The JV Co will be active in the supply of retail bulk SMS services to its advertiser
             customers. Retail bulk SMS is a service that enables businesses (such as retailers or
             financial institutions) to send high volumes of text messages to their customers.
   (188)     Retail bulk SMS is a service predominantly provided by intermediaries known as
             SMS aggregators who secure wholesale arrangements for the delivery of bulk SMS
             with one or more of the MNOs (on a wholesale market for bulk SMS)193.
             Aggregators aggregate demand for bulk SMS from multiple sources and ensure that
             messages are efficiently routed to their intended recipients through connectivity with
             MNOs around the world.
   (189)     On the basis of the market investigation, the Commission concludes that the market
             for retail bulk SMS services can be distinguished from other types of active
             messaging. Indeed, the majority of answers both from customers and competitors
             agreed on considering that retail bulk SMS services are not capable of replacing
             other mobile marketing messaging. Although some replied that they "would always
             consider the cost-effectiveness of every available channel and would be prepared to
             move advertising spend into more efficient channels"194, the vast majority of
             respondents considered that "non-intelligent" bulk SMS are generic messages and are
             not interchangeable with other forms of active messaging for the following reasons:
             the target audience is different, as bulk SMS is usually based on the sender's
             database; the scope is different (standard information, not for customer acquisition);
             data analytics is not added as a service195; there is no possibility to target the
             audience based on demographics and the consumer experience is different.196 A
             majority of respondents consider that a 5-10% increase in the price of active
             marketing messaging such as intelligent bulk SMS or IP push notifications would be
             compensated by the extra targeting capabilities of these intelligent services197.
   (190)     In view of the above, it appears that retail bulk SMS services constitute a separate
             market from active marketing messaging. The former is downstream from the
             possible market for the wholesale supply of bulk SMS services. However, for the
             purposes of the present Decision, the precise market definitions can be left open, since
             the operation is not likely to lead to a significant impediment of effective competition
             under any possible product market definition.
   193
           The term "retail" bulk SMS is used as a way of distinguishing the activities of aggregators who will, in
           most cases, have the relationship with end-customers (businesses or entities wishing to send messages)
           from the wholesale delivery of messages by MNOs to aggregators. However, it is important to note that
           aggregators themselves may arrange the conveyance of messages from other aggregators and indeed a
           message may pass through a number of layers of aggregation before reaching an MNO. In that sense,
           some aggregators may be providing a "wholesale" service to other aggregators.

   8.1.6.   Market for data analytics services
   (191)    In addition to its Transactions and advertising services, the JV Co will offer data
            analytics services to its customers. The Notifying Parties do not envisage that the JV
            Co will offer data analytics services as standalone products. The JV Co intends to
            collect and analyse the data generated from both its Transactions and advertising
            services in order to provide its customers with valuable insights into consumer
            behaviour. The JV Co's data analytics activities will comprise three main elements:
            reporting analytics, business development analytics and loyalty analytics198.
   (192)    The reporting analytics services will provide aggregated statistical reports on the
            success rates of advertising campaigns provided by the JV Co.
   (193)    Business development analytics comprise two main components: prospecting
            analytics, enabling businesses to increase their customer base by identifying new or
            lost customers and key influencers; and cross-sell analytics.
   (194)    Loyalty analytics is aimed at assisting businesses to improve their customer retention
            rates by quantifying the risk of a specific consumer looking for the products and
            services from an alternative provider, and then tailoring relevant loyalty products
            loaded with appropriate levels of value.
   8.1.6.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (195)    In the Notifying Parties' view, the JV Co would be active in the market for the supply
            of data analytics services in respect of online and offline advertising and
            Transactions services. They do not consider that it is necessary to segment the
            overall market for the supply of data analytics services in the present case.
   (196)    The Notifying Parties consider that, whilst there are certain differentiating factors
            related to the information available from mobile usage, and particularly mobile usage
            within the advertising and Transactions services of the JV Co, it would not be
            appropriate to identify distinct sub-markets within the overall data analytics field or
            to identify information related to mobile users as a distinct product market for the
            following reasons:
            (a)   most of the companies active in the mobile data analytics sector are extensions
                  of existing and long-standing web data analytics companies, which make no
                  distinction between the services required to be performed on data obtained
                  through mobile usage as opposed to traditional internet usage, or credit card
                  transaction information analytics;
            (b)   the inputs and the requirements of customers are essentially the same across all
                  formats of data analytics;
            (c)   the data analytics services to be provided by the JV Co will straddle both the
                  internet analytics field and the more traditional transactions analytics fields,
                  due to the nature of the services to be provided by the JV Co.

   8.1.6.2. The Commission's assessment
   (197)    In its previous practice, the Commission has identified a separate market for market
            research services (aimed at measuring and understanding consumer attitudes and
            purchasing behaviour) and considered whether this should be sub-divided by
            research type (consumer panel services, retail measurement services and customised
            market research)199. The Commission also identified a separate market for marketing
            information services, comprising the supply of data on individual consumers (for
            example age, social group, activities, consuming habits, address) for direct marketing
            purposes200.
   (198)    The Commission also identified the existence of marketing data services, which were
            further segmented into marketing information services, which consist of the
            provision of data (age, social group, etc.) on individual customers for direct
            marketing purposes, market research services, which are aimed at measuring actual
            purchasing patterns, and media measurement services, which are aimed at measuring
            the audience of specific media, such as television and internet201.
   (199)    The Commission assessed, in the context of the present operation, whether there
            could be a separate product market for the provision of data analytics services for
            mobile advertising.
   (200)    According to the vast majority of respondents to the market investigation, the
            provision of data analytics services for static online advertising cannot be substituted
            by the provision of data analytics services for mobile advertising, both from the point
            of view of the advertisers buying these services and the data analytics providers202.
            Indeed, the two services collect a different type of information and amount of
            consumer details. For example, the information collected via mobile data analytics is
            usually more personal, geo-located, and can be cross referenced with call behaviour,
            which cannot be offered by online data analytics to a comparable extent203. The
            online and mobile data analytics services are generally considered as complementary
            and will continue to be used in parallel.
   (201)    Furthermore, the Commission assessed whether within the mobile environment there
            could be separate markets for market research services (aimed at measuring and
            understanding consumers' purchasing behaviour) and market information services
            (aimed at supplying data on individual consumers such as age, social group,
            activities, address, etc. for direct marketing purposes). The respective replies were
            ambiguous204. However, most respondents then explained that customers purchase
            both mobile data market research and marketing information services for the

           additional insight they provide into the engagement of the consumer with the
           relevant advertising. In addition, most respondents provide they do not offer these
           two types of service separately205.
   (202)   On the basis of the above, it can be concluded that, as regards the JV Co's data
           analytics activities, there are possibly separate markets for online and mobile data
           analytics. The market investigation was rather inconclusive as regards a further sub-
           segmentation into a product market for market research and market information
           services.
   (203)   In any event, for the purposes of the present Decision, the precise product market
           definition can be left open, since the operation would not significantly impede
           effective competition under any alternative product market definition.
   8.1.7.  Market for retail mobile telephony services
   (204)   On this market, MNOs sell national and international voice calls, SMS (including
           MMS), mobile internet with data services and access to content via the mobile
           network to end customers.
   (205)   In previous decisions206, the Commission did not further subdivide the market for the
           provision of mobile communications services to end customers by type of customer
           (corporate or private, post-pay subscribers or pre-paid customers) or by type of
           network technology (2G/GSM or 3G/UMTS). The Commission therefore assessed
           the previous cases on the basis of a single market for the provision of mobile
           telecommunications services to end customers.
   (206)   For the purpose of the present Decision, it can be left open whether or not there are
           distinct sub-markets as regards mobile telecommunications services to end
           customers, since the operation would not significantly impede effective competition
           under any alternative product market definition.
   8.2.    The Relevant Geographic Markets
   (207)   According to paragraph 7 of Article 9 of the Merger Regulation and paragraph 8 of
           the Commission Notice on the definition of relevant market for the purposes of
           Community competition law207, the geographical reference market shall consist of
           the area in which the undertakings concerned are involved in the supply and demand
           of products or services, in which the conditions of competition are sufficiently
           homogeneous and which can be distinguished from neighbouring areas because, in
           particular, conditions of competition are appreciably different in those areas. This
           assessment should take account in particular of the nature and characteristics of the
           products or services concerned, of the existence of entry barriers or of consumer

   8.2.1.    Market for wholesale supply of mobile wallet platforms
   8.2.1.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (208)     The Notifying Parties consider that the relevant geographic market for the wholesale
             supply of mobile wallet platforms is at least national in scope, covering the whole of
             the United Kingdom.
   (209)     […]*209.
   8.2.1.2. The Commission's assessment
   (210)     The Commission notes first that providers of services such as Google210 intend to
             offer their mobile wallet platform on an international basis. No relevant geographic
             boundaries would appear to exist for these providers to offer mobile wallet platforms
             on a worldwide basis.
   (211)     One respondent also stressed that, while the JV Co would be a venture between three
             of the United Kingdom's licensed MNOs, all three entities are subsidiaries of global
             organizations211. Given this and the fact that the JV Co is planning to provide
             services to M(V)NOs, it is conceivable that they will leverage their global presence
             to introduce such services in other territories because the brands with which they will
             be working will seek global coverage for marketing campaigns and because they will
             sell the JV Co's products to non-participating M(V)NOs212.
   (212)     The market investigation found that some customers of payment services consider
             buying at national level and others at worldwide level. Almost half of the
             respondents stated that they considered the market for the wholesale provision of
             mobile wallet platforms as having a worldwide geographic dimension as they
             consider buying at worldwide level if costs are lower or if technology is improved.
             However, they would nonetheless have a preference for purchasing such services in
             the United Kingdom, as their main focus is the United Kingdom213.
   (213)     The Commission considers that in the present case the geographical scope of the
             wholesale supply of mobile wallet platforms seems to be at least national (United
             Kingdom) and possibly wider than national. It can however be left open whether the
             geographical scope of the market for wholesale supply of mobile wallet platforms is

            wider than national since the operation would not significantly impede effective
            competition under any relevant geographic market definition.
   8.2.2.   Market for secure storage
   8.2.2.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (214)    The Notifying Parties did not consider a market for secure storage or its geographcal
            scope.
   8.2.2.2. The Commission's assessment
   (215)    The provision of SIM-based SE secure storage appears intimately connected to the
            provision of retail mobile telephony services, markets that the Commission in
            previous decisions has found to be national in geographical scope214.
   (216)    On the other hand, the provision of secure storage on embedded SEs might
            conceivably be wider in geographical scope as the issuers of embedded SEs, in
            particular OEMs and OS providers and, possibly, issuers of external SEs and cloud-
            based secure storage are active on a worldwide basis. They therefore may be able to
            contract with retail suppliers of mobile wallet services or wholesale providers of
            mobile wallet platforms for the provision of secure storage on a basis that is larger
            than national.
   (217)    The Commission takes the view that in the present case the possible market for
            secure storage seems to be at least national (United Kingdom) in geographic scope.
            For the purpose of this operation the exact geographic market definition for a
            possible market for secure storage can however be left open as the operation would
            not significantly impede effective competition under any relevant geographic market
            definition.
   8.2.3.   Market for retail distribution of mobile wallet services to customers
   8.2.3.1. The view of Notifying Parties
   (218)    The Notifying Parties consider that the relevant geographic scope of the market for
            the retail distribution of mobile wallet services is at least national. They do not
            anticipate actively offering mobile wallets to consumers outside of the United
            Kingdom, reflecting the fact that the payment cards and services that will be offered
            via the mobile wallet will relate to SPs in the United Kingdom.
   (219)    The Notifying Parties do however expect that their competitors, such as Google and
            PayPal, will offer these services to consumers across multiple countries215 and would
            therefore be active on a global basis. They take the view that, while there is no basis
            for identifying regional or local markets, it can be left open whether the relevant

           The Notifying Parties moreover have the aspiration that the JV Co mobile wallet will be interoperable
           with the various wallet initiatives in other EU Member States, allowing users to use their mobile wallet
           when they travel across the European Union (and potentially elsewhere).

            market for the retail distribution of mobile wallet services to customers may be wider
            than national216.
   8.2.3.2. The Commission's assessment
   (220)    Regarding the geographic market for the retail distribution of mobile wallets to
            customers, the majority of respondents to the market investigation considered that
            the market for the retail supply of mobile wallet services is national in scope217. This
            is consistent with the fact that a majority of them also consider that mobile payments
            will be priced differently according to geographic areas218.
   (221)    Several points raised in the market investigation confirm this delineation. First of all,
            the main actors involved in the provision of mobile wallet services are based in the
            United Kingdom. Some respondents argued that most users will acquire mobile
            wallets from local M(V)NOs and will load credit cards on their mobile wallet
            associated to their local bank account. Therefore, the contractual relationship that a
            mobile wallet end-user will have with its particular M(V)NO and with its credit
            institution or bank will tie the mobile wallet to a location219. As retail mobile
            telephony markets and retail banking markets have previously been found to be
            national in scope by the Commission, the connections that exist between these
            markets and the retail market for mobile wallets may favour the view that the latter
            market also has a national dimension220. Moreover, the advertising services that can
            be offered through mobile wallets, such as voucher redemption or loyalty cards, tend
            to be at most national in nature221. Therefore, retail providers of wallet services as
            well as end-users thereof would likely consider mobile wallet services without
            customisation to a national market as inferior.
   (222)    In addition, some respondents raised issues related to interoperability. Some stated
            that NFC-enabled devices are not interoperable across different Member States of the
            European Union, more particularly as standards do not encompass the full
            transaction chain and may therefore vary between member States222. Payment
            methods may differ from one country to another and impede interoperability. Some
            other respondents held the view that NFC-enabled devices are interoperable or will
            soon be223. However, they nonetheless consider that payment methods are issued at a
            national level and, as they may differ from one country to another, this could impede
            interoperability. Similarly, a majority of the respondents points to the existence of
            specific national limitations224 such as national payment and security regulations or
            specific PIN-entry rules and transaction requirements, which can differ across the
            EEA225.

   (223)    However, several respondents assert that the retail market for mobile wallet services
            to end-users is a worldwide market as the MNOs are acting on a global level226.
            According to those respondents, the Notifying Parties have the capabilities to reach
            customers worldwide (or to reach a worldwide market)227.
   (224)    The Commission takes the view in the present case that the market for the retail
            distribution of mobile wallet services seems to be at least national (United Kingdom)
            in geographic scope. For the purpose of this case the exact geographic market
            definition for the retail distribution of mobile wallet services to customers can
            however be left open since the operation would not significantly impede effective
            competition under any relevant geographic market definition.
   8.2.4.   Market for advertising services
   8.2.4.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (225)    In relation to the advertising services provided by the JV Co (and the possible sub-
            markets), the Notifying Parties submit that the geographic market definition is at
            least United Kingdom-wide if not wider.
   8.2.4.2. The Commission's assessment
   (226)    Many respondents to the market investigation considered that many mobile
            advertising networks (or "ad networks" – which are companies that connect
            advertisers to web sites that want to host advertisements) have a significant global
            presence228. According to a respondent "[t]he existence of many global players in
            this space is due to the fact that the costs for customizing mobile advertising
            networks for local markets are very low. In particular, the technology used for each
            country or region are identical or broadly similar. Global mobile advertising
            networks also face vigorous competition from local mobile advertising networks"229.
            Furthermore, publishers willing to sell mobile advertising space in the United
            Kingdom do not limit themselves to intermediaries based in the United Kingdom230.
   (227)    However, it also appears that "[t]he majority of publishers sell their inventory
            through intermediaries based in the UK because they are offering access to a UK
            based audience."231. In addition, almost all of the advertising customers who replied
            to the market investigation prefer to buy services from advertising intermediaries that
            are located in the United Kingdom232.
   (228)    The main reasons for this are the different linguistic and legal requirements, consumer
            habits and handset usage across various Member States. Although many of the JV Co
            competitors are global players, a national presence is pointed out as important and

            preferable. According to many respondents this reasoning applies to the different types
            of mobile advertising.
   (229)    In view of the above, the geographic market for advertising services and its possible
            sub-markets seem to be national (United Kingdom) in scope. However, for the
            purposes of the present Decision, the exact geographic market definition can be left
            open, since the operation would not significantly impede effective competition under
            any possible geographic market definition.
   8.2.5.   Market for retail and wholesale bulk SMS services
   8.2.5.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (230)    The Notifying Parties consider that the relevant geographic scope of the market for
            retail bulk SMS services is at least national, covering the whole of the United
            Kingdom.
   (231)    As regards the wholesale delivery of bulk SMS services, the Notifying Parties submit
            that the relevant geographic market is at least national and may be even wider than
            the United Kingdom, because aggregators can, and do, route SMS internationally and
            then back into the United Kingdom to take advantage of the low rates for delivering
            internationally-originated SMS to subscribers in the United Kingdom. It is therefore
            possible that the MNOs also face competition from international operators in the
            market for the supply of wholesale bulk SMS delivery to mobile subscribers in the
            United Kingdom.
   8.2.5.2. The Commission's assessment
   (232)    Many of the customers buying bulk SMS services mainly do so on a national basis,
            because the providers (aggregators) of retail bulk SMSs have access to and better
            knowledge of the local market and prices applied by retail bulk SMS providers in the
            United Kingdom are different from those applied by providers located outside of the
            United Kingdom. However, most respondents submitted that most of the providers of
            bulk SMSs are international players, who have international agreements with MNOs.
   (233)    The majority of respondents to the market investigation confirmed that aggregators
            having to send retail bulk SMSs in the United Kingdom also use services of MNOs
            outside of the United Kingdom. However, aggregators responded that "some UK
            network operators cannot reach international networks"233, or that "[i]t is feasible
            that bulk SMS terminated in the UK can be routed via MNOs outside the UK. These
            include routes which are covered by AA19 agreements (i.e. internetworking fees are
            charged), although more likely are the so-called 'grey routes' where AA19
            agreements aren't in place owing to the lower delivery costs"234. Therefore, it
            appears possible for aggregators to use wholesale suppliers of bulk SMSs outside of
            the United Kingdom.

   (234)    Therefore, the geographic scope of the (possible) market for retail bulk SMS services
            appears to be national (United Kingdom) or possibly wider in scope; the (possible)
            market for wholesale bulk SMS services appears to be broader than national.
   (235)    As regards both the market for retail and wholesale bulk SMS services, the precise
            geographic market definition can be left open in the present case, since the operation
            would not significantly impede effective competition under any alternative
            geographic market definition.
   8.2.6.   Market for data analytics services
   8.2.6.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (236)    The Notifying Parties consider that the geographic scope for the market for data
            analytics services (and its relevant sub-markets) is at least national in scope, covering
            the whole of the United Kingdom.
   8.2.6.2. The Commission's assessment
   (237)    Several respondents to the market investigation indicated that a local presence of a
            data analytics provider and the knowledge of local specificities and language could
            be useful235. Furthermore, customers prefer United Kingdom based data analytics
            providers for the provision of consultancy services on British markets, and to have a
            British content of the contracts they sign with data analytics providers. At the same
            time, most data analytics suppliers are global companies and the services are often
            provided on a cross-border basis.
   (238)    As regards the JV Co's data analytics activities and any relevant sub-markets, for the
            purposes of the present Decision, the precise geographic market definition can be left
            open, since the operation would not significantly impede effective competition under
            any alternative geographic market definition.
   8.2.7.   Market for retail mobile telephony services
   (239)    In previous decisions236, the Commission considered the relevant geographic market
            for mobile telecommunication services to end customers (and any possible sub-
            market) to be national in scope. This is based on the fact that mobile tariffs operate
            on a national basis and that regulation (such as spectrum allocation, numbering and
            mobile termination) is also done on a national basis.
   (240)    The Commission concludes that, consistent with its previous decisions, the
            geographic market is restricted to the United Kingdom.

   9.      COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
   9.1.    Introduction
   (241)   Under Article 2(2) and (3) of the Merger Regulation, the Commission must assess
           whether a proposed concentration would significantly impede effective competition
           in the common market or in a substantial part of it237. In this respect the Commission
           has assessed all markets affected by the operation.
   (242)   As regards mobile transaction services, the relevant markets for the assessment of the
           operation are the upstream market for the wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform
           services, the market for secure storage, the downstream market for the retail
           distribution of mobile wallets to customers, and the market for retail mobile
           telephony services. All these markets have a geographical scope that is at least as
           wide as the United Kingdom and maybe wider238.
   (243)   As regards the JV Co's advertising services, the relevant markets for the competitive
           assessment of the operation are the markets for mobile advertising intermediation
           and its potential submarkets as well as the wholesale and retail supply of bulk SMS
           services. In addition, the market for data analytics with its possible sub-markets is
           also relevant for the competitive assessment in the present case.
   (244)   The Commission has mainly focused its market investigation on assessing the
           likelihood of competitive harm arising, as a result of the operation, from possible
           foreclosure strategies, in particular in view of the very strong positions that the
           Notifying Parties have together on the retail mobile telephony market in the United
           Kingdom. As a consequence, this section will first assess the possible non-horizontal
           effects of the operation on the markets for mobile wallet and bulk SMS and then
           examine the possible horizontal effects of the operation on the markets for wholesale
           supply of mobile wallet platform services and the markets for mobile advertising
           services and the supply of data analytics.
   (245)   For the assessment of possible horizontal effects, the Commission has considered the
           situation absent the operation. On the basis of the outcome of the market
           investigation, the Commission considers that the Notifying Parties would be (and to
           some extend are already) able to offer their mCommerce services without the JV
           Co239. However, it is not necessary for the purpose of the present Decision to reach a
           conclusion on this as the operation would not significantly impede effective
           competition under any alternative scenario.

         The competition assessment is conducted on a market consisting of the whole of the United Kingdom.
         On any broader geographic market, similar conclusions of absence of any likely significant impediment
         to effective competition would be reached.

   9.2.      Non-horizontal effects – vertical effects
   9.2.1.    Mobile Wallet Services
   9.2.1.1. Preliminary remarks
   (246)     According to the Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, a merger is said to result in
             foreclosure where actual or potential rivals' access to supplies or markets is
             hampered or eliminated as a result of the merger, thereby reducing these companies'
             ability and incentive to compete. Such foreclosure is regarded as anticompetitive
             where, as a result of the merger, the merging companies, and possibly also some of
             its competitors, are able to profitably increase the price charged to consumers240.
   (247)     When assessing the likelihood of such an anticompetitive foreclosure scenario, it
             must be examined "first, whether the merged entity would have, post-merger, the
             ability to substantially foreclose access to inputs, second, whether it would have the
             incentive to do so, and third, whether a foreclosure strategy would have a significant
             detrimental effect in the competition downstream"241.
   (248)     In this Decision, the Commission ascertains whether the Notifying Parties may
             exercise their strong collective position in the market for retail mobile telephony
             services (and in any possible sub-market) in order to substantially foreclose other
             potential entrants in the wholesale mobile wallet platform market from offering
             competing mobile wallet platform services. According to the Non-Horizontal Merger
             Guidelines, two types of foreclosure are possible: input foreclosure and customer
             foreclosure242. In the current case the Commission assesses the likelihood of a
             strategy to either technically or commercially foreclose access to essential inputs for
             the provision of mobile wallet products offered to end consumers; these essential
             inputs are the SE as well as the placement of apps on a mobile handset allowing the
             mobile wallet to function. Such input foreclosure could harm or deteriorate
             competitive conditions in the wholesale mobile wallet platform services market (for
             example by leading to higher prices for Service Providers) and would also impact
             competitive conditions in the retail mobile wallet market downstream. Thus, the
             Commission examines below the Notifying Parties' ability and incentive to engage in
             such input foreclosure.
   (249)     For the reasons set out in this section, the Commission does not consider that there is
             a risk of customer foreclosure in the present case243. While it is true that absent the
             operation the Notifying Parties would be potential customers on the wholesale
             platform for the provision of a mobile wallet, they are not critical customers as a
             considerable number of potential customers on that market would remain (for
             example banks, M(V)NOs). Moreover, there are a number of other vertically
             integrated market players with direct access to end customers. Such market players

            do not rely on access to potential customers on the wholesale platform for the
            provision of mobile wallets and could offer mobile wallets in the United Kingdom if
            they wished to do so (for example Google or Apple) (see also section 7.1.3.1).
            Moreover, none of the participants in the market investigation raised material
            concerns related to a possible customer foreclosure on the part of the JV Co or the
            Notifying Parties.
   (250)    The Notifying Parties submit that they are currently not active in the provision of
            mobile wallet platform services and have very limited activities in the provision of
            NFC offline mobile transactions.
   (251)    Given the nascent state of the mobile wallet markets, no meaningful market shares
            can be provided for the market in the United Kingdom. Moreover, given the fact that
            the technologies relating to mCommerce are evolving quickly, the Commission's
            assessment is based on the information currently available and takes into
            consideration the most likely developments in the sector, as reported by all sources
            of information available at the time of the present Decision.
   (252)    On the basis of the market investigation, the Commission has investigated in
            particular whether the Notifying Parties would:
            (a)     have the technical ability to substantially foreclose competing mobile wallet
                    providers through a variety of potential means (see section 9.2.1.2);
            (b)     have the ability and the incentives to engage in commercial foreclosure of
                    competing mobile wallet providers through a variety of potential means (see
                    section 9.2.1.3).
   9.2.1.2. Assessment of technical foreclosure
   (253)    As regards the technical ability to substantially foreclose competing mobile wallet
            providers, it should first be noted that a majority of respondents to the market
            investigation expressed the opinion that the Notifying Parties would not have the
            technical ability to prevent or limit their competitors’244 ability to offer mobile wallet
            services other than through the JV Co245. It should also be noted that the Notifying
            Parties submit that the JV Co will provide access to the other MNOs and MVNOs on
            non-discriminatory terms246. In particular, all technical details will be developed by
            the JV Co in accordance with industry standards and circulated openly to Service
            Users and potential Service Users on a non-discriminatory basis247.
   (254)    Several respondents to the market investigation indicated that the Notifying Parties
            might be in a position to control key elements in the mobile handset that are
            necessary to offer mobile wallet services. In particular, access to the SIM-based SE

           would be critical to the Notifying Parties' competitors in order to offer mobile wallet
           services248.
   (255)   Access to an SE appears to be fundamental to the functioning of mobile wallets.
           Although it is, in principle, possible that transactions made from a mobile handset
           could be completed via solutions which would use software-based secure solutions
           where the payment credentials would be stored in the cloud (see Recital (54)), such
           solutions are considered at this stage to be less secure or too slow to be used at the
           PoS as they require entering username and passwords249. Such solutions would
           appear to be viable in the medium to long term250. The Notifying Parties explain that
           while it is possible that security can be provided via software rather than hardware,
           they are not aware of any specific examples that are under development. In addition,
           micro SDs, stickers or sleeves could also constitute an alternative to a SIM-based or
           embedded SE. However, at this stage, these solutions also seem to be considered as
           somewhat less convenient. For instance, Google explained that many mobile
           handsets do not have MicroSD slots, which limits the usefulness of using a MicroSD
           as a mean to “distribute” NFC technology and that the MicroSD hardware could
           interfere with a mobile handset's radio performance, and IBM explained that
           additional hardware lack secure storage capacity251.
   (256)   The Commission therefore considers that the current most likely means of providing
           a mobile wallet to customers is by using a SIM-based SE, or alternatively an
           embedded SE.
   (257)   Thus, the Commission first assesses whether the Notifying Parties would be able to
           substantially foreclose competitors from offering customers a mobile wallet
           competing with the one offered through the JV Co by refusing access to the SE
           located in the SIM-based SE.
   (258)   Secondly, assuming that access to the SIM-based SE was refused, the Commission
           assesses whether competitors could still offer their mobile wallets by accessing an
           alternative SE embedded inside the mobile handset's hardware, or whether the
           Notifying Parties would also be able to substantially foreclose competitors from
           offering customers a mobile wallet competing with the one offered through the JV
           Co by refusing access to this alternative embedded SE.
   (259)   The Commission nevertheless notes, as this is a nascent and evolving market, that if
           in the future new technologies based on software, cloud-based SEs, micro-SD, NFC
           stickers or sleeves, or alternative solutions were to come to market, as could
           reasonably be expected considering technological evolutions, they would provide

            Co and the Notifying Parties.
   Technical ability to substantially foreclose competing mobile wallet providers by
   foreclosing access to the SIM-based SE
   (260)    All respondents to the market investigation which replied to the specific question on
            control of the SIM-based SE stated that MNOs would exert control over SIM-based
            SEs252. In particular, Lloyds Banking Group raised its concern that SIM-based SEs
            would become the standard SE for mobile wallets253.
   (261)    The Notifying Parties themselves submitted during the second phase investigation
            that they own and control the access to the SE if it is placed inside the SIM card.
            They explained that in the United Kingdom, the M(V)NOs provide and own the SIM
            card which is inserted into its customer’s mobile handset. The M(V)NO is the issuer
            of this SIM-based SE. Accordingly, the M(V)NO (as issuer) has what is referred to
            as the “content management rights”254 and controls access to this SE. The M(V)NO
            can delegate some of these content management rights to a properly authorised third
            party, granting permission to the latter to perform the content management tasks.
   (262)    The Notifying Parties further explain that […]*255.
   (263)    In light of the above, the Commission concludes that the Notifying Parties would
            have the technical ability to substantially foreclose access to SIM-based SEs to
            competing mobile wallet providers for the retail mobile telephony contracts they sign
            with their customers (where they provide the SIM card to the customer) in the United
            Kingdom256. This conclusion would not change if the delineation of the geographic
            market was wider than the United Kingdom, as the Notifying Parties predominantly
            offer their retail mobile telephony contracts to customers resident in the United
            Kingdom.

   (264)   Access to the SIM-based SE could in principle be bypassed by competing mobile
           wallet providers if they could access other SEs placed somewhere in the mobile
           handset other than inside the SIM card of the Notifying Parties.
   (265)   SEs can either be embedded in the hardware of the mobile handset (a solution
           proposed by several OEMs257 selling mobile handsets in the United Kingdom), or
           inserted in an external device tagged onto the mobile handset. As an example, Visa
           already offers mobile payment solution using such SE in the United Kingdom.
   (266)   These alternatives are very likely to be used by competitors offering transaction
           services.
   (267)   The most likely alternative to the SIM-based SE would be the embedded SE. Several
           OEMs are starting to release new smartphones with dual SE architecture (including
           one SE directly embedded in the mobile handset, and one SE which would be inside
           the SIM card) and such architecture is likely to become frequent for newly developed
           smartphones258. The Notifying Parties submit that mobile handsets with dual
           architecture represent more than [80-90]% of their sales of NFC-enabled mobile
           handsets between January and April/May 2012. The Notifying Parties further stated
           that these dual architecture mobile handsets have embedded SEs which have not been
           disabled or disconnected and are capable of working with a mobile wallet if requested
           by a customer259. Moreover, various technical methods exist to allow the co-
           existence on a mobile handset of both a SIM-based and an embedded SE, some of
           which even imply that mobile handset users are unaware as to precisely which SE
           is actually used by a given application on their mobile handset. (see also Recital
           (115))
   (268)   This availability of dual architecture smartphones clearly opens the way for
           competitors to offer their products to consumers using embedded SEs. It is also
           likely that competitors would consider using stickers, at least in the short term, in
           order to maximize their consumer reach, for example the sticker based PayTag
           offered by Barclays and Visa in the United Kingdom260.
   (269)   As the most likely alternative to the SIM-based SE would be the embedded SE, the
           Commission focuses its assessment of technical foreclosure on the ability by the
           Notifying Parties to degrade the functionality of rival mobile wallets that would
           require the use of an embedded SE. This degradation could essentially take one of a
           variety of forms, which we consider in turn below.
   257
         For instance, RIM with its Blackberry Curve 9360, Bold 9900, Bold 9790, and 9860 models, HTC with
         its One X and Desire C models, Samsung with its Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy SIII models, and
         SonyEricsson with its Xperia S model, which all support dual SE architecture (embedded SE and SIM-
         based SE), and Samsung with its Galaxy note which supports embedded SE only. (Response from the
         Notifying Parties to the Commission's Request for Information of 24 May 2012, question 13).
   258
         The Commission considers that uncertainty about what SE model(s) will eventually prevail in the
         market is one important reason why OEMs are offering dual SE architecture on their handsets. The
         offering of additional functionalities on their mobile handsets is also likely to be an important factor for
         the OEMs' decisions, as customers would favour functionality-rich smartphones.

   Technical ability to block or degrade a competing mobile wallet app, that required an
   embedded SE, from being downloaded, installed or updated on a handset operating on
   the networks of the Notifying Parties.
   (270)   To make a payment with their mobile handsets, consumers would have to either use a
           mobile wallet app which is pre-installed by OEMs on the mobile handset, or
           download an app from an app store (for example Google Play or iTunes).
   (271)   The Commission assessed whether the Notifying Parties may be technically able to
           ensure that consumers would be unable to download the necessary mobile wallet app,
           or use it.
   Views of the Notifying Parties
   (272)   The Notifying Parties submit that it is not technically possible for an MNO to block
           (or degrade) the downloading, installation or updating of a (competing) mobile
           wallet app261.
   (273)   Apps, if not pre-installed on a mobile handset, can be downloaded from an app store
           (for example iTunes for Apple, Google Play for Android) and installed on the user’s
           smart-phone. Mobile wallet apps (like Google Wallet) are the same.
   (274)   The Notifying Parties submit that downloading an app is intuitive and very easy and
           that smartphone and tablet users rely primarily on app downloads to build and
           expand the features and functionality of their devices.
   (275)   They explain that MNOs cannot technically prevent the downloading of a particular
           app without blocking access to the entire app store over their network. This is
           because such blocking would require blocking access to the app store’s IP address.
           Any attempt to access the app store over the MNO’s network would then fail.
   (276)   According to the Notifying Parties, it would be commercially impossible for any
           MNO to block traffic from and to an entire app store such as Google Play. If an
           MNO were to attempt to do so, many (if not most) smartphone users would abandon
           that MNO as a supplier because a basic and essential functionality of the smartphone
           would be disabled. Any such action would be widely and rapidly disseminated
           amongst the public and lead to serious commercial and reputational consequences.
   (277)   In addition, even if hypothetically an IP address were to be blocked, the mobile
           handset user could still access the app store and download apps via a Wi-Fi
           connection, or by hooking up his or her smartphone to a USB connection on his or
           her PC (where the app will be downloaded first onto the PC and then loaded on the
           smartphone, for example as with iTunes). These are easy ways to “circumvent” the
           MNO’s mobile network.
   (278)   Competing mobile wallets that are installed might in principle also be hampered by
           blocking traffic to or from them, for instance by disabling the right to connect to
   261

           certain IP addresses they try to reach over the mobile network (for example for
           online payments, or for updates of the app). Again, however, the Notifying Parties
           submit that the mobile wallet apps can utilise other data connections for
           communication purposes and any such blocking could be circumvented by using a
           different IP address or routing traffic via another IP address.
   (279)  The Notifying Parties also explain that MNOs may seek to block or throttle Voice
           over IP ("VoIP"), including Skype, as a matter of traffic management, to enforce
           appropriate tariff structures, avoid network overload at peak times, avoid degrading
           the network efficiency for others or avoid "bill shock" in case of surplus charge for
           data usage. They submit that traffic management is closely linked to net neutrality
           and the Notifying Parties do not generally interfere with the user's usage of their data
           capacity and the only limits are those resulting from applicable law (seeking to block
           illegal content) or from the user's own choice of tariff, which is in line with Ofcom's
           approach in the United Kingdom262.
   (280)  Furthermore, the Notifying Parties submit that app updates are "pushed" onto the
           handset over the internet through the OS without the knowledge or consent of the
           MNOs263.
   (281)  They further explain that data is sent over the internet in so-called packets, each
           containing ‘address’ information about the sender and the recipient as well as the
           actual data. Routers use the address information to determine where the packets
           should be sent. There is no need to inspect the actual contents of the data packets in
           order to deliver the packets to the recipient264.
   (282)  With a technique called Deep Packet Inspection (“DPI”), it is however possible to
           look at the contents of the data. Once the use of a certain application has been
           discovered by using DPI to analyse the data traffic, these apps could be blocked or
           hampered by dropping the data packages instead of delivering them to their
           destination.
   (283)  The Notifying Parties nonetheless explain that DPI has a number of technical limits
           which make it unsuitable for blocking or hampering traffic to or from electronic
           wallets.
   (284)  First, the DPI method cannot be used for NFC payments, which do not use the
           mobile network, but rather NFC radio transmission.
   (285)  Second, DPI is not effective if the data traffic is encrypted, which will very often be
           the case, and at a minimum for online payments, communications with banks, and
           provisioning apps onto the SE.
   (286)  DPI tools may look for other indications about the type of application if the traffic
           itself is encrypted and the individual packets cannot be inspected, by relying on what

         is called a heuristic analysis. This analysis would look for an identifiable pattern of
         communication, that might be seen as a signature. These other indications may
         include speed, frequency, bit pattern and packet size. Thus, for example, DPI
         software may seek to recognise file sharing or video streaming by the traffic
         characteristics which these apps generate. These high volume data apps may have
         recognisable patterns.
   (287) However, when considering encrypted traffic associated with a mobile wallet, the
         Notifying Parties explain that it is far harder to distinguish that from other
         communications on the basis of these other indications . Given that it is different
         from file sharing and video streaming, traffic associated with online wallet services
         would be much harder to distinguish from other traffic as it is far more similar to
         typical online communication. This traffic will not be distinguishable with the
         required level of accuracy for DPI to be effective. The online wallet traffic is not
         sufficiently distinguishable from other traffic that the MNO does not seek to interfere
         with. It may be that the mobile wallet traffic has a signature; however, that signature
         is not distinguishable from other (non-wallet) traffic or from the MNO’s mobile
         wallet traffic.
   (288) Third, an identifiable ‘application signature’ is required to identify the packets
         associated with particular application traffic. While certain services typically use an
         application specific protocol and can be identified this way (for example Voice over
         IP services like Skype), this is not the case for all data communication. Data traffic
         related to mobile wallets will typically not have such a ‘special’ protocol signature.
         That means that the protocol could not be used to identify the service (and thus to
         block or hamper it).
   (289) Furthermore, the Notifying Parties submit that it is not possible for the MNOs to
         identify apps by inspecting their Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") certificates because
         the same SSL certificate could be used for different apps. The application developer
         can determine which information is written on the certificate and could easily
         obfuscate the application by ensuring that the certificate does not contain information
         by which the application can be identified.
   (290) Seeking to apply DPI for the purpose of blocking traffic that does not have a
         particularly distinguishable pattern will lead to many errors. It would give customers
         an unsatisfactory service of (seemingly randomly) failed communications (including
         of traffic not related to the mobile wallet). This would induce customers to switch
         operators in search of a better quality of service and would risk significant
         reputational damage for operators in their overall relations with their customers.
   (291) For these reasons, DPI would not be an effective method to block or hamper apps or
         wallet solutions provided by third parties.
   (292) Moreover, the Notifying Parties submit that mobile wallets (for example multiple
         app-centric wallets besides the container wallets) require access to the apps in the SE
         via an API. MNOs could request that a mobile handset manufacturer leaves some
         APIs out of the mobile handset in an attempt to block rival mobile wallets. However,
         this would be a business decision of the OEM. It is not within the technical means of
         the MNO. OEMs will also have license agreements with the OS providers which
EN                                             66                                                EN

          they need to comply with. The OS will likely provide such APIs and changes would
          not be allowed.
   (293)  Finally, the Notifying Parties explain that pre-installed wallet apps (that MNOs may
          require OEMs to pre-install on the mobile handsets they sell) will not have a
          technical advantage over dowloaded competing mobile wallet apps. This is because
          downloaded wallet apps, like any app, will install themselves on the mobile handset
          with the support of the OS, and MNOs have no influence or control over the OS or
          the interactions between the OS, apps and hardware, except between the MNO-
          branded mobile wallet and the SIM-based SE265.
   The Commission's assessment
   (294)  Assessing the technical ability of the Notifying Parties to substantially foreclose
          competing mobile wallet providers is a technical exercise in a technologically
          complex industry. Therefore, the Commission has entered into close communication
          with the United Kingdom telecom regulator (Ofcom), which has proven independent
          technical expertise. Ofcom assessed in detail the submission of the Notifying Parties
          on technical foreclosure. In substance, Ofcom concluded that the Notifying Parties'
          assertions are reasonable in the current state of technology and application of mobile
          wallet services.
   (295)  As regards the technical possibility for MNOs to prevent the downloading of a
          competing mobile wallet app without blocking access to the entire app store, two
          MNOs which are not part of the JV Co confirmed that it would not be possible266.
   (296)  Furthermore, as regards the technical possibility for MNOs to stop a consumer using
          their 3G or Wi-Fi connection to download apps (for example from PayPal) from app
          stores such as Google Play or iTunes, several respondents stated that it was not
          possible.267
   (297)  Visa submitted that the Notifying Parties may be able to block the downloading of
          either the mobile wallet app that customers will use, or the Visa Mobile Payment
          Application (VMPA) that must sit on the SE. However, the Commission notes that
          this submission is based on the assumption that the Notifying Parties have control of
          the handset OS, whereas in fact, on the basis of the market investigation, the
          Commission can conclude that the Notifying Parties cannot technically modify the
          OS of the mobile handset by themselves, but can only do so if they request the OS
          provider to make changes on their behalf268 (see Recitals (451) to (465)).
   (298)  Three UK also confirmed that an MNO cannot stop an app from being installed on a
          consumer’s device once downloaded from the app store269. This is because control
          depends upon where the app is downloaded, if it is via Google Play or Apple App

           Store, updates are routed via those stores and an MNO will not be able to specifically
           block an update.
   (299)   Three UK submitted that MNOs could stop an app from using the MNO’s data
           connection to pull information into the app. For instance, an MNO could impede
           much of the wallet functionality by preventing updates of the account balance or
           spend history. However, the Commission notes that Three UK confirms that updates
           could still be performed via a Wi-Fi connection (even though it may be less
           convenient to consumers as Wi-Fi is not widely available outside of the home)270.
   (300)   Importantly, Ofcom confirmed the Commission's understanding that access to the
           MNO broadband connection can be used to initially activate an embedded SE and the
           mobile wallet, but that alternatively, this activation can also be done with USB or a
           Wi-Fi connection (although this might be somewhat less convenient from a customer
           perspective). In Ofcom's view, the same holds true for software upgrades and
           services. If the MNO wished to foreclose access, it could do so with respect to the
           MNO broadband connection (that is to say it may be technically feasible), but it
           would be less likely to be technically feasible to prevent the use of other access
           services (for example USB or Wi-Fi). For the payment transaction via NFC, no
           access to the MNO network is needed, as the handset with the NFC device is
           mimicking a passive device being contacted by the PoS terminal271.
   (301)   Ofcom272 further explains that under certain circumstances, it is technically feasible
           (but not necessarily practical or desirable) to selectively block unencrypted app
           download URL273 links, where app download links are served over Hypertext
           Transfer Protocol ("HTTP"274). In the context of mobile wallets, such blocking of
           discrete unencrypted application download URLs would be evident to end-user
           consumers, in that the blocked links would not work. The Commission shares
           Ofcom's assessment.
   (302)   However, such URL blocking could be side-stepped in a relatively simple way. Upon
           in-depth assessment of the Ofcom report, the Commission considers that Google
           Play is delivered via an encrypted network connection, (via HTTPS275), making the
           blocking of discrete URLs impractical in this instance. Ofcom believes that to place
           an application download link or service over an encrypted network connection is
           trivial to implement, thereby defeating any URL blocking by MNOs. It is also
           possible to block encrypted URLs (by discarding IP packets) or entire domains using
           Domain Name System blocking. However, in both techniques there is a tendency to
           “over block” which would likely become evident to both customers and third parties.
           The Commission, using the Ofcom report as a crucial input for its reasoning,
           considers that it would therefore be trivial for the affected party to move to a

           domain.
   (303)   As regards the use of DPI to block the download of competing mobile wallet apps,
           Three UK submits that DPI relies on network packet headers, packet patterns, etc. (in
           other words signatures) to identify protocols and apps. This allows DPI to perform
           advanced network management, provide enhanced user services and perform security
           functions such as blocking of spam. For many years MNOs have used DPI for better
           network planning, to manage congestion in their networks and to mitigate malicious
           traffic. According to Three UK, this could be extended to hamper wallet services
           with relative ease. DPI can be an effective method to selectively block the download
           of third party apps. In the case of pre-installed apps, DPI could also be employed to
           block data or manage down the quality of service of the app276.
   (304)   However, the Commission considers, on the basis of Ofcom's report277 that in
           substance the Notifying Parties’ conclusions regarding the use of DPI are correct. In
           particular, it would not be technically possible for a network based DPI device to
           examine the IP packet payload when the session is encrypted by Transport Layer
           Security ("TLS").
   (305)   It is true that where unencrypted traffic is used, it is technically possible to intercept
           this traffic using DPI. The GlobalPlatform278 states that the payment communication
           is between the NFC-enabled device and the PoS equipment and therefore does not
           utilise Internet Protocol networks in this interface. Provisioning and administration of
           network traffic associated with a payment app residing on an SE would be the traffic
           susceptible to interception via DPI. However, the Commission, after analysing the
           Ofcom report, shares Ofcom's view that DPI is generally rendered ineffective by the
           use of widely available network encryption methods such as HTTP traffic delivered
           over SSL or TLS279.
   (306)   PayPal submits that the Notifying Parties have the potential ability to control internet
           and mobile network access. For example, they can restrict access to adult content or
           to competing voice over the internet services, such as Skype.
   (307)   However, as was confirmed by Ofcom280, blocking payment traffic is not analogous
           to blocking an illegitimate website showing for example adult content. In order to
           block an illegitimate website showing for example adult content, all traffic from a
           given IP would be blocked (the access to the entire website would be blocked).
           However, the objective of blocking competing mobile payment apps would be more
           subtle, as it would be to block only some content (namely the transaction initiation)
           of a given IP, but not the entire traffic from a given IP (for example the IP of a bank).
           Blocking all the traffic from a given IP would not make economic sense for the

         In the agreed minutes of telephone conference call of 6 June 2012, p.2, regarding the description of
         DPI, Ofcom clarifies that "DPI inspection is limited in its efficacy against encrypted traffic (e.g. via
         SSL). In general, it can be applied, but it both blocks legitimate traffic and might also fail to block
         illegitimate traffic (e.g. by "padding" of packages)."

           Notifying Parties as blocking all traffic to and from their bank website would make
           customers very unhappy, as they would for example not be able to perform their
           usual online banking activities. These risks of customer un-satisfaction militate
           against the possibility that access is blocked by the Notifying Parties.
   (308)   Furthermore, any attempt by the Notifying Parties to block websites or apps for
           reasons other than traffic management or blocking of illegal content would be likely
           detected by consumers or the owners of these websites and Ofcom, which would
           affect the behaviour of the Notifying Parties in this regard. The Commission
           considers that this would also likely apply to the other technical foreclosure
           strategies assessed in the present Decision.
   (309)   In the context of the analysis of the likelihood of an attempt by the Notifying Parties
           to substantially foreclose competing mobile wallet providers, the Commission also
           has considered the possibility that the foreclosure conduct in question may be
           unlawful or may give rise to regulatory intervention which would constrain the
           Notiyfing Parties' ability to foreclose.
   (310)   Regarding the foreclosure strategies relating to degrading the service offered by
           competing wallets over the mobile network of the Notifying Parties, that is to say by
           means of the blocking of IP addresses or the use of DPI and traffic management, the
           Commission is of the view that Ofcom might very well intervene. In November
           2011, Ofcom has expressed concern to this effect281: “Our stance as a regulator is
           that any blocking of alternative services by providers of internet access is highly
           undesirable, because of the potential effect on innovation. Similarly, whilst we
           recognise that some forms of traffic management may be necessary in order to
           manage congestion on networks, we expect such traffic management practices to be
           applied in a manner which is consistent within broad categories of traffic. Where
           providers of internet access apply traffic management in a manner that discriminates
           against specific alternative services, our view is that this could have a similar impact
           to outright blocking”.
   (311)   These hypothetical foreclosure practices by blocking traffic or treating traffic in a
           differentiated way would be without any countervailing justification related to
           network performance or congestion or proper remuneration of network usage.
           Therefore, because of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom, the
           Notifying Parties would have to treat their own wallet apps in the same way as those
           of third parties, leading to the result that they would block or degrade their own
           wallet traffic to make their practices defendable.
   (312)   In such instance, regulatory intervention by Ofcom would be likely282, reducing
           further the incentive of the Notifying Parties to adopt the conduct concerned.

         In its Report "Approach to Net Neutrality", Ofcom also warned about regulatory intervention if
         blocking was widespread and persistent. In this regard, in their reply to the Commission's Request for
          Information of 24 May 2012, the Notifying Parties argue that a distinction should be the present
          foreclosure scenario and VoIP and how that is approached in the overall net neutrality debate. In case of
          VoIP, operators may offer VoIP services as part of some tariff packages and thus consumers have a
          choice. In the foreclosure scenario with regard to traffic degradation of mobile wallets, that would not

   Conclusion
   (313)     On the basis of the above, it is most likely that the Notifying Parties have no ability
             to technically block or degrade a competing mobile wallet app from being
             downloaded, installed or updated on a handset operating on the network of the
             Notifying Parties.
   Technical ability to block or degrade the functionality of or deactivate an embedded SE
   after it has been installed.
   Views of the Notifying Parties
   (314)     The Notifying Parties283 submit that the OEMs are the issuers of embedded SEs and
             control access to them, as OEMs will have the content management rights. The
             Notifying Parties cannot block access or degrade the functionality of the embedded
             SE because they do not have the necessary technical keys to enter the embedded SE.
             They cannot change or determine access rights to embedded SEs.
   (315)     Furthermore, they explain that any communication inside the embedded SE passes
             through the processor, follows the Java Card processing rules, and is outside the
             reach of the MNO (or any other provider)284.
   (316)     The Notifying Parties also submit that any communication between the embedded SE
             and a competing mobile wallet is also outside the reach of an MNO as it is secured
             and does not travel over the MNO network but inside the mobile handset, according
             to the specifications set by GlobalPlatform285.
   (317)     Furthermore, the access to the embedded SE from outside the handset over the
             internet or via the NFC antenna would also be outside the MNO technical reach as
             they do not use the MNO network.
   (318)     Finally, according to the Notifying Parties, the access to the embedded SE from
             outside the mobile handset over the air is within the reach of an MNO but is securely
             encrypted end-to-end and cannot be inspected by an MNO by any means, including
             DPI software, and as a result cannot be interfered with.
   The Commission's assessment
   (319)     HTC, an OEM, stated that the Notifying Parties are not in a position to technically
             deactivate or hamper the performance of an embedded SE after it has been installed,
             and that only an OEM could do so286. Nokia, another OEM, also stated that it is not
           be the case and the Notifying Parties would seek to deny consumer choice. That would trigger Ofcom's
           intervention.

            possible for an MNO to disable the operations of an embedded SE by technical
            means287, but that an MNO may request an OEM to disable the embedded SE288 (a
            point which will be addressed below in section 9.2.1.3 on commercial ability and
            incentives to foreclose).
   (320)    Two MNOs which are not part of the JV Co also stated that it would not be possible
            for an MNO to technically deactivate the embedded SE by itself289.
   (321)    The Commission considers, in particular on the basis of the Ofcom report290 that
            MNOs do not ‘own’ non-SIM based SEs, and, as a result, activating and controlling
            such a SE would not be under the control of the MNO (although enabling some
            aspects may rely either in part or in whole on access services, such as mobile
            broadband connections, that the MNO may provide for some customers). If access to
            the MNO broadband connection can be used to initially activate an embedded SE,
            this can alternatively also be done with USB or a Wi-Fi connection As a result, if the
            MNO wished to foreclose access, it could do so with respect to the MNO's
            broadband connection (that is to say it may be technically feasible) but is unlikely to
            be technically feasible to prevent the use of other access services (for example USB
            or Wi-Fi)291.
   Conclusion
   (322)    On the basis of the above, it is most likely that the Notifying Parties have no ability
            to technically block or degrade the functionality of or deactivate an embedded SE
            after it has been installed.
   Technical ability to subordinate the operation of a competing mobile wallet so that
   preference is automatically given to the SIM-based SE / Notifying Parties’ mobile wallet.
   Views of the Notifying Parties
   (323)    The Notifying Parties292 submit that it is possible to have both a SIM-based SE and a
            mobile handset-embedded SE functioning on one and the same mobile handset. It is
            also technically possible to have both a SIM-based SE and an embedded SE “active”
            at the same time, that is to say, operating in a mode such that the contactless reader
            would be able to call on either SE.
   (324)    According to them, the co-existence of a SIM-based SE and an embedded SE on one
            mobile handset would not necessarily create technical difficulties in selecting the
            “active” SE. In this model, the SE that is currently activated by the user will receive
            all commands from the contactless reader (via the NFC antenna) to communicate the
            card details in order to execute a payment or other service. For completeness, they
            add that the routing of the command from the NFC antenna on the mobile handset is,

          technically, a matter for the OEM or the OS provider. Interaction between different
          hardware components (in this case the two SEs and the NFC controller) falls outside
          the scope of the MNO’s technical abilities and is typically a matter for the OS
          provider (or possibly the OEM).
   (325)  Furthermore, MNOs do not have the technical ability to subordinate the operation of
          a rival mobile wallet so that preference is automatically given to the SIM-based SE
          or the mobile wallet based on the JV Co platform. The MNOs would have to rely on
          an OS provider or OEM to configure the mobile handset’s software and hardware to
          subordinate the operation of a rival mobile wallet. According to the Notifying
          Parties, the MNOs do not have the technical ability to control the default SE setting.
          That is a matter for the OS provider or OEM.
   (326)  Where multiple SEs are present on a single mobile handset, the Notifying Parties293
          explain that there might be some kind of prioritisation mechanism in place to decide
          which SE has preference over the other(s). However, currently, there are no
          standards available that specify this prioritisation. Therefore, according to the
          Notifying Parties, any prioritisation depends on the implemented architecture in the
          handset and OS, which are controlled by OEMs or OS suppliers. The OS software
          will likely include a graphical interface allowing the consumer to select the mobile
          wallet which it wants to be activated. That means that the consumer will be in control
          of this type of prioritisation as well, just as he or she is in control of the prioritisation
          of the available apps installed on the SE.
   (327)  According to the Notifying Parties, the customer will expect that when a mobile
          wallet is started the appropriate SE will be activated to allow all services related to
          that mobile wallet to operate. Ultimately, the customer thus decides and the MNO
          cannot interfere with the customer’s choice294. If one was to take away the menu
          setting where a customer can identify the active mobile wallet and change the
          selection, only the OS provider or the OEM would be able to do so. An OS provider
          such as Google could more easily set Google Wallet as the default wallet via its
          control over the mobile handset's OS. The MNO would however not be technically
          able to determine which wallet would be the default as it does not control the low
          level software on the mobile handset that would direct the prioritisation between the
          wallets and SEs and cannot change that without the approval of the software
          owner295.
   The Commission's assessment
   (328)  All OEMs who replied to the relevant question in the market investigation
          questionnaire stated that there currently exists no standards or specifications which
          govern which SE is the default SE or which SE has priority where multiple SEs are
          present on the mobile handset, and which mobile wallet is the default mobile wallet

           or which wallet has priority in case multiple mobile wallets are present on the
           handset296.
   (329)   A majority of OEMs considered that neither the SIM-based SE, nor the embedded
           SE, is the default requirement for certain mobile handset OSs297.
   (330)   One MNO not participating in the JV Co also stated that it would be technically
           difficult, and in the control of the OEMs that control the mobile handset's OS to give
           technical preference to the mobile wallet of the JV Co298.
   (331)   Visa explained that the Proximity Payment System Environment ("PPSE") is
           standardised in EMVCo specifications299. These specifications identify the priority of
           payment apps supported within the SE(s) of a mobile handset. A contactless reader
           will automatically select the highest priority recognised payment app that is listed in
           the PPSE. Consumers can change the hierarchy of any app listed in the PPSE through
           the Application Activation User Interface (AAUI). The standard for the AAUI is also
           defined by EMVCo300.
   (332)   Importantly, Ofcom301 explained that the technical standards and specifications that
           facilitate the co-existence and end-user selection of different SEs have not yet
           reached maturity, and that there is on-going activity and development in this area.
           Further technical standards and specifications are likely to emerge which may
           influence user selection and interoperability of SIM-based and embedded SEs.
           According to the Ofcom, it is unclear when these standards and specifications will
           emerge and they understand that at the moment, only SIM-based SEs have agreed
           standards and specifications. However, Ofcom further explains that this does not
           imply that the SIM-based SE is selected by default in case of multiple SEs, but rather
           that by the lack of a uniform standard or specification for SE selection, the selection
           will be done according to the preconfigured setting implemented by the OS provider,
           and that eventually, it is the consumer who will be able to configure his or her mobile
           handset and determine default settings302.
   (333)   Google303 stated that there currently exists no standard or specification governing
           which SE a given PoS command would be routed to. In practice, within the hardware
           of an Android handset, the NFC controller (which is a piece of software included in a
           NFC-enabled OS) contains the functionality to decide which SE a PoS command
           should be routed to. In the case of mobile handsets operating the Android OS,

          whoever controls the NFC controller on the mobile handset will determine which SE
          a PoS command is routed to.
   (334)  The Commission understands that because the Android OS is open source (open
          source software are computer software that are available in source code form: that is
          to say the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for copyright

          control the manufacturing of their Android mobile handsets (or, in most cases, the
          specifications of a particular mobile handset will be the result of a commercial
          negotiation between the OEMs and MNOs).
   (336)  Therefore, the Commission considers that given its market power, as soon as Google
          launches its Google Wallet in the United Kingdom305, Google may try and then
          would likely succeed in convincing OEMs that the SIM-based SE should not be the
          default SE, and that as a result, it is not clear whether OEMs and MNOs would reach
          an agreement as to which of the competing SEs should be set as the default SE.
   (337)  Google306 further clarifies that it is the customer that will determine which mobile
          wallet application is used. Google expects that this choice will be made at the
          checkout stage of a particular purchase. In other words, according to Google, there is
          no such thing as a default mobile wallet (that is to say automatically selected without
          customer intervention) in the manner that, for example, a default web browser may
          exist.
   (338)  The Commission, looking in particular at Ofcom's submissions, considers that the
          selection of the default SE will ultimately be a matter for the customer to decide.
   (339)  The Commission acknowledges that there may be advantages for a mobile wallet to
          be pre-selected as the default mobile wallet in the settings of the mobile handset.
          However, the Commission considers that for an app enabling payments in shops or
          online, which may be considered as an important app for consumers, in terms of
          perceived security, benefits, etc., the consumer will likely select the payment app that
          he or she chooses to pay its goods or services with.
   (340)  Three UK307 also explained that the Notifying Parties could request the exclusion of
          key APIs308 in an outward attempt to block rival mobile wallets. In addition,

         An API is a specification intended to be used as an interface by software components to communicate
         with each other. An API may include specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, and
         variables. An API specification can take many forms, including an International Standard such as
         POSIX or vendor documentation such as the Microsoft Windows API, or the libraries of a

           according to Three UK, rival mobile wallets could be subordinated by the Notifying
           Parties in more subtle ways, such as the following:
           (a)    User interface – the mobile wallet application and associated “widget” could be
                   “hard coded” into a homepage of the handset, in such a way that a user will be
                   presented with the MNO’s preferred wallet app or widget whenever they pick
                   up their mobile handset;
           (b)    Default settings – whenever a customer clicks on mobile wallet apps, an
                   interstitial page could be imposed which asks “Do you want to use JV Co's
                   Wallet?”.
   (341)   First, the Commission notes that requesting OEMs to exclude key APIs is not a
           technical ability from the part of an MNO but rather a commercial ability, which will
           be analysed below in section 9.2.1.3. Furthermore, as concluded by the Commission
           in Recital (338) it will ultimately be up to the consumer to decide which mobile
           wallet he or she desires to select as his or her default mobile wallet.
   (342)   Moreover, Three UK309 confirms that the possibility to feature dual SE architecture is
           becoming a reality. Nevertheless, according to Three UK, the influence that global
           MNOs have on OEMs should not be underestimated and it is yet to be seen whether
           large MNO groups will, in the longer term, demand mobile handsets with only one
           form of SE. This has already been seen in the United States of America where the
           MNO Verizon purchased a variant of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus which would not
           support Google Wallet.
   (343)   The Commission investigated the example mentioned in Recital (342) with Google
           and Verizon in order to understand whether it may be relevant for the assessment of
           the present operation. In the United States of America, the recently launched Google
           Wallet has been unavailable on the Galaxy Nexus mobile handset on the Verizon
           network. This was widely reported by the press as being the consequence of Verizon
           blocking the Google Wallet because it is a party to the ISIS310 mobile wallet
           platform, which is a potential competitor of Google Wallet.
   (344)   The Commission considers that there are several differences between the Verizon
           and Google issue, and the operation which takes place in the United Kingdom:
           (a)    Firstly, as explained by the Notifying Parties311, MNOs in the United States of
                   America are able to exert greater control over the supply of mobile handsets on
                   their network than MNOs in the United Kingdom. MNOs continue being the
                   primary distribution channel for mobile handsets in the United States of
                   America. This has marginalised indirect retailers of mobile handsets in the
                   United States of America who do not source their own handsets but sell
                   handsets that are provided by the MNOs. As discussed in Recitals (42) and
         programming language, e.g. Standard Template Library in C++ or Java API. See

         ISIS is a joint venture created by AT&T Mobility, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless, to develop a

         See Annex 33 to the Form CO, paragraph 7.
EN                                                    76                                                   EN

                (43), the situation is different in the United Kingdom, where independent
                retailers sell around [40-50]% to [50-60]% of all mobile handsets. This has
                implications for the commercial ability and the incentive of the
                Notifying Parties to substantially foreclose competitors (see section 9.2.1.3);
         (b)    Secondly, another difference is related to the type of technology used in the
                United States of America and the United Kingdom. In the latter, MNOs use
                technologies standardised by the GSMA (for example GSM, WCDMA) which
                implies that mobile handsets are generally technically compatible across the
                MNOs' networks. In the United States of America, this is not the case as
                different MNOs use different families of technologies, some of which do not
                use SIM cards. The key competing technologies are CDMA/CDMA2000 and
                GSM/W-CDMA. In general mobile handsets are not technically compatible
                between the technologies. For example, according to the Notifying Parties,
                [90-100]% of Verizon’s customers are using CDMA/CDMA2000
                technology and will generally have mobile handsets that are not technically
                compatible with a GSM or W-CDMA network used by AT&T. Furthermore,
                within CDMA technology, mobile handsets cannot easily be switched between
                operators. This means that a customer in the United States of America
                cannot purchase a mobile handset from a third party and use it on one of the
                CDMA networks or necessarily switch from one MNO to another - even if
                both MNOs use the same technology - while keeping the same mobile handset.
                By contrast, in the United Kingdom any pay monthly customer out of contract
                or on rolling monthly contracts can easily switch networks. Likewise, the 16%
                of adult smartphone users in the United Kingdom who have a pay as you go
                service could easily switch networks. Given the differences in technology
                MNOs in the United States of America have a greater incentive to seek to
                negotiate exclusive mobile handset supply deals than in the United
                Kingdom. Again, these issues have significant consequences for the ability and
                the incentive of the Notifying Parties to substantially foreclose competitors in
                the United Kingdom;
         (c)    Thirdly, Verizon explained that the non-pre-installation of the Google Wallet
                was part of a commercial agreement between Verizon and Google, which could
                have been otherwise negotiated subject to changes in other contractual terms.
                The outcome of the Verizon / Google commercial discussions has also to be
                seen against this fundamentally different competitive landscape, as described in
                the two above Recitals. Besides, regardless of what has exactly happened, the
                Commission notes that Google Wallet is now available on AT&T networks312
                (a party to the ISIS joint venture competing with Google Wallet);
         (d)    Fourthly, in any event, the Commission considers that this point relates more to
                a commercial ability to foreclose by requesting OEMs to customise the mobile
                handsets they purchase with only a SIM-based SE, rather than a pure technical
                ability to foreclose without the agreement of an OEM. This will be analysed
                below in section 9.2.1.3.
   312
       Report by KBW "Was 2011 really "Year Zero"?", page 25: “However, just recently, AT&T allowed
       Google Wallet to be downloaded on just two of its handsets, which may indicate a softening of this
       stance.”
EN                                               77                                                       EN

   (345)   Each of the above reasons is sufficient to conclude that the issue between Verizon
           and Google, identified in the United States of America, is not directly relevant for the
           assessment of foreclosure by technical means as a result of the present operation.
   (346)   It can therefore be concluded that in case of a mobile handset with a SIM-based SE
           and an embedded SE, it is the OS provider and not the OEMs that would likely do
           the first configuration of the preference settings for the SE, and that it will ultimately
           be the consumer that will be able to configure the settings as he or she wishes.
   Conclusion
   (347)   On the basis of the above, it is most likely that the Notifying Parties have no
           technical ability to subordinate the operation of a competing mobile wallet so that
           preference is automatically given to the SIM-based SE or the Notifying Parties’
           mobile wallet.
   Create de facto standards or specifications which would foreclose competing mobile
   wallet providers
   Views of the Notifying Parties
   (348)   The Notifying Parties submit that it is not envisaged that the JV Co will be creating
           any new standards313. Instead, it will be utilising pre-existing openly available
           standards in the creation of its mobile wallet platform. Operating norms for how
           these standards are utilised in practice will only be created to the extent they are
           necessary for establishing an open and interoperable platform and common core user
           experience.
   (349)   The JV Co will support the development of suitable open standards for NFC in
           mobile handsets, namely those NFC handset and SIM specifications being developed
           by GSMA with the assistance of the […]*314 […]*, in addition to the EMVCo
           NFC payment standards. These various bodies are described in more detail in the
           following Recitals.
   […]* NFC
   (350)   The […]* NFC initiative, which started in late 2010, looks wider than the
           United Kingdom and focuses in particular on NFC mobile handset and SIM-card
           specifications. The […]* NFC initiative was set up to help expedite the deployment
           of NFC services by agreeing on concrete specifications in a way that would ensure
           interoperability of the different mobile transaction initiatives on a pan-European
           basis. […]*

   (351)   In July 2011 the two specifications on NFC handsets and SIM-cards developed by
           the […]* NFC initiative have been submitted to the GSMA in order to provide other
           operators with the opportunity to participate in the specifications setting process.
           Several MNOs, including Three UK, have already participated through the GSMA in
           this way. These specifications complement those developed through the original
           GSMA Pay-Buy-Mobile ("PBM") project. The Notifying Parties submit that the JV
           Co and other national NFC projects, will not have any role in the development of
           these specifications or the implementation of these specifications but will use those
           specifications in establishing their commercial arrangements.
   GSMA
   (352)   The GSMA Pay-Buy-Mobile ("PBM")315 project is an umbrella for all NFC related
           work streams in the GSMA and looks wider than the United Kingdom. Its objectives
           include developing relevant standards or specifications for a common global
           approach for mobile NFC payments in particular, issuing guidelines and supporting
           pilot projects and sharing information regarding best practices. All GSMA full
           members have the opportunity to participate in PBM and the project has been
           supported by over 60 MNOs worldwide (this does not include Three UK). PBM has
           delivered a number of white papers, including handset guidelines. However, the
           Notifying parties submit that the pace of the project has been slow for some time.
           The GSMA PBM project was started in 2007.
   (353)   The GSMA316 submits that it is not a “standards” body in the classic sense of the
           word in the telecommunications industry, and has no powers to set binding standards
           for the industry such as European Telecommunications Standards Institute ("ETSI")
           does. It may, however, contribute to the development of “technical specifications in
           product or services markets where compatibility and interoperability with other
           products or systems is essential” as per paragraph 257 of the Horizontal
           Guidelines"317. The GSMA further holds that although it is not an approved
           Standards Development Organisation (for example like ETSI) the work of GSMA "is
           based on open standards from bodies such as 3GPP/ETSI, OMA etc. to ensure
           interoperability of services across mobile networks" and it "does produce additional
           specifications and guidelines, aimed at turning the standards into reality and
           providing additional information and processes required to launch actual services."
   (354)   GSMA is currently developing technical specifications for a common global
           introduction of mobile NFC payments, including the following requirements for SIM
           cards and mobile handsets:

           throughout the course of 2012, which the JV Co would then adopt324.

   (356)   The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has developed a
           number of standards for NFC SIM cards, including the following:

         GSMA process for consultation and approval by its wider membership. The GSMA notes that "… the

         wallet providers to use the embedded SE”. The GSMA has taken a clear and consistent position

           companies. Therefore it covers at the same time the interests of the various owners of
           secure elements.
   Other relevant standards and specifications
   (360)   In addition to the SIM, NFC handset and EMVCo standards and specifications, the
           JV Co is also likely to adopt mobile wallet apps standards and specifications to
           facilitate Cross-Service User interoperability and portability of mobile wallets
           between different mobile handsets. The GSMA is currently inter alia developing
           standard specifications for apps and it is anticipated that these will also be adopted
           by the JV Co.
   (361)   The Notifying Parties do not anticipate other regulatory barriers to entry. The most
           significant product certification requirements relate to the main card schemes: Visa
           and MasterCard. Each of these card schemes operates its own certification scheme,
           requiring certain standards and specifications (most notably related to security of
           consumer's payment credentials) to be fulfilled before a format will be certified to
           their members.
   (362)   It is […]*.
   (363)   However, in order to enable physical NFC payments to be made with Visa and
           MasterCard branded credit cards, the JV Co and card issuers will need to satisfy
           payment scheme operators, such as Visa and MasterCard, that it meets their scheme
           certification requirements. Without satisfying the applicable scheme's certification
           requirements, the JV Co and card issuers will not be permitted to allow "virtual"
           versions of that particular scheme's credit cards to be placed in the mobile wallet.
   (364)   Both Visa and MasterCard have established their own scheme certification
           requirements, with which the JV Co will need to comply in order for Visa and
           MasterCard payment cards to be placed in the mobile wallets of the Notifying Parties
           and other service Users of the JV Co. In particular, card issuers need to ensure the
           following:
           (a)    That their NFC technology complies with the EMVCo requirements;
           (b)    That the secure application on the SIM complies with the EMVCo
                  requirements;
EN                                               81                                               EN

           (c)    That the security test confirming that the whole mobile wallet protects the
                  virtual card, is satisfied.
   (365)   At present, each card issuer would have to gain individual certification from
           MasterCard or Visa and then be required to fulfil further testing with each M(V)NO
           to ensure compliance with the M(V)NO's requirements. Instead of this, the JV Co
           intends to aggregate all of the testing requirements of participating M(V)NOs for
           card issuers into a single test process329. This common set of tests would cover
           systems integration testing, style guide adherence testing, user experience testing and
           conformity to OS variations.
   (366)   As far as online payments are concerned, no specific engagement will be needed
           between the JV Co and the relevant payment scheme operator (such as Visa or
           MasterCard), reflecting the fact that, in executing an online transaction on behalf of a
           consumer, the JV Co will simply be passing that consumer's card details on to the
           relevant merchant in a secure manner.
   The Commission's assessment
   (367)   The Commission investigated whether the Notifying Parties could create de-facto
           standards and specifications, to which they would prevent providers of rival
           wholesale mobile wallet platform services having access, thereby foreclosing them
           from offering competing mobile wallets.
   (368)   Three UK330 argued that in order to operate an NFC-based mobile wallet it would be
           necessary to develop certain standards and specifications going beyond the already
           existing standards and specifications, as claimed by the Notifying Parties. The JV Co
           would develop closed standards and specifications that would become de facto
           standards and specifications that the whole industry would be forced to use and the
           JV Co would have the freedom to license or not and to establish conditions in
           relation to their use. Three UK fears that as a result of the merger it would have to
           become a customer of the JV Co and it would be impossible to develop alternative
           mobile wallets.
   (369)   Lloyds Banking Group stated that while technical standards have already been
           developed for NFC communications and mobile contactless payments, it expects that
           further standards would still need to be created. The JV Co could develop these still

         Response of Three UK to Questionnaire Q1 of 7 March 2012 question 73.1: "Although the JV partners
         have stated that the JV will be based on open standards (see Annex 2), it is our view that new de facto
         and/or proprietary standards will need to be created. For example, standards to facilitate simultaneous
         payment and coupon redemption do not currently exist, and standard interfaces and processes will be
         defined by the JV for it's interaction with the banking and advertising industries. Furthermore, there
         appears to be little justification for why the standardisation of interfaces to the banking and advertising
         industries should be defined by the incumbent mobile operators alone. The JV’s governance will
         preclude any influence (or equality) in the definition and evolution of standards over time, ensuring that
         any such standards created will be designed to favour the JV partners. It is also to be expected that
         there will be a delay before any technical standards are made available to MNOs/MVNOs that are not
         JV partners."

          outstanding standards in a direction that would limit the ability of third party
          providers to supply their own mobile wallet331.
   (370)  PayPal332 also submitted that while basic NFC communication standards and
          specifications have been developed, there are currently no standards or specifications
          for combining payment with coupon redemption – an area that is likely to be
          controlled by the JV Co. The JV Co platform would provide the Notifying Parties
          with the ability to adopt strict standards and specifications, limiting consumers’
          access to competing service providers, who may very well offer a better and more
          attractive user experience. This, according to PayPal, would enable the Notifying
          Parties to discriminate between competing services and their own mobile wallets on
          the JV Co platform, in particular by controlling access to the only currently workable
          method of NFC-based payments through standardisation and certification
          requirements embedded in its SIM-based technologies. According to PayPal, the JV
          Co is likely to become the gatekeeper in the payments ecosystem through control of
          a single sponsored standard or specification concentrated in the hands of a single
          firm. The JV Co would have the market power to dictate the standards/specifications
          – and through the distribution power of the Notifying Parties the JV Co standards
          and specifications would become the industry standards and specifications.
   (371)  Furthermore, PayPal also expressed a concern that the JV Co and the Notifying
          Parties could entrench the Card Emulation mode (see Recital (51)) using an SE, at
          the expense of an uptake of the P2P mode, which PayPal believes to be more flexible
          and open333. If the consumer and the merchant both have devices supporting P2P,
          then a two-way communication from the cloud via the two devices (mobile handset
          and PoS terminal) allows confirmation of the consumer presence at the PoS, reducing
          risk of fraud. PayPal explained that today PoS terminals are set by default to support
          Card Emulation Mode (many PoS terminals also support P2P, but this mode in most
          instances is not activated or is disabled), and there is a strong incentive for both
          MNOs and existing card issuers to push Card Emulation, because it would maintain
          the strong position of issuing banks (versus new entrants such as PayPal). By
          hardwiring the Card Emulation mode into the SE, MNOs could easily entrench the
          existing players and shape consumer expectations in future years that existing cards
          simply transfer onto the Card Emulation mode. According to PayPal, the problem is
          compounded further by the tendency of retailers to adopt the dominant choice,
          meaning that Card Emulation readers could quickly become the new standard,
          limiting the uptake of the P2P standard that PayPal prefers.
   (372)  The Commission has considered in detail PayPal's arguments. In relation to NFC
          payment standards, as discussed in Recital (358), the main standard-setting
          organisation is EMVCo, which adopts NFC standards that apply to mobile payments
          as well as to contactless cards. The EMVCo standards are being shaped by the card
          issuers, in particular by Visa and MasterCard and the Notifying Parties have very
          little influence over them.
   (373)  In addition, the Commission notes that PayPal is successful in concluding
          agreements with PoS terminal providers to allow the PayPal mobile payment

           application to be used in-store. In the United States of America, PayPal and Verifone
           entered into a comprehensive agreement in May 2012 that advances PayPal
           acceptance at large retailers. Verifone's press release334 claims that "the Verifone
           solution is future-proof so that adding new options, such as NFC, will be easy to
           implement when they become available. Secondly, in January 2012, PayPal signed
           an agreement with Ingenico, which will enable merchants equipped with Ingenico
           PoS devices to accept PayPal payment options335. A similar agreement was made
           with Equinox in May 2012336. Although these agreements are in the United States of
           America, they demonstrate that PayPal's solutions are successfully enabled in PoS
           terminals. Finally, in the United Kingdom PayPal promotes innovative payment
           solutions. In May 2012, PayPal was reported to launch a new payment service for
           using a mobile app to pay online through the cloud337. The Commission therefore
           considers that the JV Co will not have a greater ability to influence the NFC
           standards than other market participants, and that PayPal will continue to have
           similar negotiating power to promote innovative solutions in relation to mobile
           payments.
   (374)   Further investigation, in particular with manufacturers of PoS terminal readers and
           potential competitors or customers in the field of mobile payment also enabled the
           Commission to understand that as far as mobile payments are concerned, rules and
           specifications developed by Visa and MasterCard already exist for contactless
           payments (as explained in Recital (364)) and, even if mobile payments are still a
           nascent technology as a result it is likely that changes to the current specifications
           will be needed to reflect improvements in technology and security updates, the
           Notifying Parties would not be in a position to create proprietary standards or
           specifications in this field.
   (375)   For instance, HSBC explained that the NFC/SE environment has comprehensive and
           consistent standards and specifications which are understood, stable and mature and
           notes that EMVCo and card scheme rules (set by Visa and MasterCard) play an
           important role in that matter338.
   (376)   A financial institution also confirmed that virtually all aspects of NFC and mobile
           contactless payments are already covered by technical standards and
           specifications339.
   (377)   Visa also explained in particular that Visa branded NFC mobile cards within the JV
           Co's wallet will only be able to conduct Visa NFC mobile transactions at Visa-
           enabled contactless readers. It also explained that Visa has developed specifications

   (378)   The result of the market investigation as regards the question of whether or not there
           already exist standards or specifications governing the interoperability between SIM-
           based SEs and mobile wallet apps was not conclusive. For instance, Bouygues
           Telecom explained that the interoperability was still under standardisation and that
           the proprietary APIs of Gemalto were becoming de facto standards and
           specifications. Three UK explained that Android does not currently provide a
           standard API for allowing apps to access a SIM based-SE, and Telia Sonera
           explained that GSMA has defined requirement specification(s) and that access
           control is provided by the GlobalPlatform341. The Commission considers that this
           may reflect the evolving nature of this nascent technology.
   (379)   Moreover, as far as enabling customers to pay, redeem coupons and claim loyalty
           points at the same time with their mobile handsets (the "one-tap" solution), on the
           basis of the market investigation, the Commission has found that no standard
           specification exists and that the Notifying Parties would have to create their own
           specifications342, or use the standards and specifications developed by market
           participants such as Google or VeriFone343.
   (380)   Nevertheless, Google, in order for its Google Wallet to work, also developed
           proprietary specifications to enable simultaneous payment-coupons-loyalty points'
           redemption and manufacturers of PoS readers stated that these proprietary
           specifications could co-exist on PoS readers for different mobile wallets to

         First Data submits that PoS terminals are not yet equipped with standards or specifications for the
         processing of non-payment transactions such as voucher redemption and loyalty points awarding. There
         are different potential ways to set these standards and to upgrade terminals accordingly. The
         development of such standards or specifications is expected to take place within industry association
         type bodies, such as EMVCO or according to international card schemes (Visa, MasterCard). First Data
         will adopt those standards/specifications as required by the industry. Agreed minutes of telephone
         conference call of 3 May 2012 with First Data.
   343
         Verifone submits that there are only standards and specifications for payment transactions (set by Visa
         and MasterCard). For vouchers and loyalty points, operators such as Google have to develop a specific
         protocol. VeriFone tries to also provide an open API framework so any mobile wallet which enables
         vouchers could interact with its terminals. VeriFone expects that global standards will ultimately
         develop. Regarding the certification process for VeriFone terminals, there is no standard certification
         for contactless payment terminals. VeriFone has its terminals certified separately by Visa, MasterCard,
         etc. The different certification processes change regularly, but they are valid worldwide, except for Visa
         which has developed different versions in some regions (for example Visawave for ASPAC). Agreed
         minutes of telephone conference call of 24 May 2012 with Verifone.
   344
         Verifone submits that there are no patents covering the single-tap technology. Google would have
         developed its specifications for Google wallet and would own the respective proprietary rights. The API
         for implementing these specifications on VeriFone's terminals is developed by VeriFone on the basis of
         these specifications; VeriFone owns the property rights to this API. VeriFone has also developed its
         own general environment for supporting mobile wallets to function on its terminals. Therefore, it would
         be simple to offer a service similar to Google single tap to other undertakings. Agreed minutes of

   (381)     In May 2010 the Cityzi project for interoperable commercial services combining
             transport ticketing systems, secure mobile payments, several retail projects and other
             tourism services on mobile handsets was launched in France. More than 1 million
             NFC mobile handsets are currently using this service345. During the experiment it
             appears that the current GlobalPlatform standard or specification for the connections
             between the TSM and the management of the SEs were not clear enough for example
             for loyalty cards. Therefore the Association Française Sans Contact Mobile has
             created new standards or specifications to resolve the issue346. These standards or
             specifications are now under discussion and approval by GlobalPlatform and are also
             included in the GSMA Fast track project347.
   (382)     Based on the above, it can be concluded that it is most likely that the Notifying
             Parties will not be in a position to create de facto standards and specifications348 that
             no other market participant could use, hereby foreclosing competing mobile wallet
             providers.
   9.2.1.3. Assessment of commercial foreclosure
   Conceptual background on commercial foreclosure
   (383)     For the purpose of the present Decision, the Commission considers “commercial
             foreclosure” as a strategy which relies on the Notifying Parties' ability and incentive
             to substantially foreclose rival mobile wallet providers using commercial, rather than
             technical means. Commercial foreclosure is therefore mainly implemented
             indirectly349, for instance by negotiating with third parties, such as OEMs, to induce
             them to take commercial measures which may block or hamper rival mobile wallet
             providers, or by incentivizing third parties such as independent retailers to market
             mobile handsets bundled with the JV Co mobile wallet over mobile handsets that
             include rival mobile wallets.
   (384)     In contrast to technical foreclosure, it is more difficult to establish whether or not the
             Notifying Parties have the ability to engage in commercial foreclosure. This is
             because this type of foreclosure depends on the relative balance of power between
             the Notifying Parties and other parties involved in the mobile wallet market (for
             example OEMs, OS providers), as well as on the counterstrategies that rival
             wholesale mobile wallet platform service providers could deploy. These
             considerations imply that commercial foreclosure may not be fully effective, but
             nonetheless that the Notifying Parties could engage in forms of partial commercial
             foreclosure if they wished to do so. The counterstrategies that could be deployed by
             rival mobile wallet providers in order to frustrate a commercial foreclosure strategy
             also have a bearing on the likely cost of such a strategy for the Notifying Parties, and
             therefore on the assessment of the incentives to engage in foreclosure.

           the Notifying Parties and the JV Co post-merger would have the ability and incentive
           to substantially foreclose the wholesale market for the provision of wallet platform
           services and whether a foreclosure strategy would have significant detrimental
           impact on competition downstream. The Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines also
           recognize that "[..] in practice, these factors are often examined together as they are
           closely intertwined"350.
   (386)   Assuming that the Notifying Parties would have the ability to substantially foreclose
           rival mobile wallets, it would need to be considered whether they also have the incentive
           to do so. When engaging in a foreclosure strategy, parties typically face a trade-off
           between additional profits in the foreclosed market and losses in any adjacent market
           that is affected by foreclosure (for example because of the inefficient exclusion of a
           trading partner in the adjacent market)351. In the NFC-enabled mobile wallet market,
           the profits from foreclosure would essentially stem from the additional revenues in
           the market for wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform services which would be
           captured as a result of the exclusion of rival wholesale mobile wallet platform service
           providers. The creation of the JV Co would increase the profit from foreclosure since
           it would eliminate competition between the Notifying Parties in wholesale supply of
           mobile wallet platform services market. This would increase their profits in the
           upstream market for the wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform services given
           the high combined market shares in the retail mobile telephony market of the
           Notifying Parties. These additional revenues could, for instance, take the form of
           increased access fees to Service Users and Service Providers, and potentially higher
           revenues for renting space on the SIM-based SE (see section 8.1.2)352.
   (387)   The (opportunity) cost of foreclosure would essentially be due to the lower
           downstream retail mobile telephony profits associated with not being able to offer to
           subscribers a wider choice of mobile wallet options downstream and (depending on
           the exact foreclosure mechanism) a full choice set of mobile handsets.
   (388)   The Commission considered whether a commercial foreclosure strategy could be
           implemented by a single Notifying Party on its own, irrespective of the strategies of
           the remaining Notifying Parties, or whether under any potential foreclosure scenario
           the Notifying Parties would rely on joint (or collective) implementation of a
           foreclosure strategy.
   (389)   Given that each Notifying Party would only foreclose a relatively small part of the
           mobile wallet market by acting on its own, that is to say its own customer base, it
           would be unable to exclude competitors from the remaining mobile wallet market.
           This would severely undermine the effectiveness of foreclosure. In particular, each

         Note that as competitive conditions in the other markets in which the JV Co will be active (advertising,
         data analytics) are fundamentally different from those in the wholesale mobile wallet market, an
         increase in mobile wallet profits due to foreclosure will only have limited spill-over effects on the
         advertising and data analytics markets (see also Recital (434).

           Notifying Party only has between [ 20-30]% and [ 30-40]% of the retail mobile
           telephony market share, which means that on their own they could only foreclose a
           limited part of the market for the wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform services.
           The Commission concludes that each Notifying Party would not have the ability and
           incentive to engage in a commercial foreclosure strategy on its own independently of
           the conduct of the other Notifying Parties.
   (390)  As a result, the assessment remains to be carried out as to whether the Notifying
           Parties could or would develop a joint (or collective) foreclosure strategy.
   (391)  When considering any hypothetical joint foreclosure strategy, it is important to bear
           in mind that it is not the JV Co directly that would be implementing the joint
           foreclosure strategy, but rather each Notifying Party.
   (392)  In its assessment the Commission explores two distinct types of incentives for the
           Notifying Parties to engage in a joint foreclosure strategy: unilateral incentives
           (which would give rise to "unilateral effects" of the operation); and coordinated
           incentives (which would give rise to "coordinated effects").
   (393)  Unilateral incentives to engage in a joint foreclosure strategy would arise if each of
           the Notifying Parties were to find it profitable to foreclose rivals, given that the other
           Notifying Parties are also implementing the same strategy. If this condition holds, no
           Notifying Party faces the unilateral incentive to deviate from the joint foreclosure
           strategy. In this case, the existence of the JV Co may act as a device that allows the
           Notifying Parties to align their strategies and foreclosure competitors. The existence
           of unilateral incentives to engage in a joint foreclosure strategy would imply that this
           outcome could be sustained in a “static” setting, without the need for a deterrent
           mechanism based on future punishment of any firm that would deviate from the
           strategy. The unilateral decision to foreclose rival wallets would be optimal for each
           Notifying Party if the gain from deviating from such a foreclosure strategy (that is to
           say the acquisition of additional subscribers from the other Notifying Parties which
           are engaging in such a foreclosure strategy) is small compared to the incremental
           profits that would accrue to the Notifying Party through the JV Co as a result of
           foreclosure.
   (394)  Coordinated incentives to engage in a joint foreclosure strategy would arise if the
           Notifying Parties were to find it profitable to tacitly coordinate on this strategy. The
           existence of incentives of this type would be based on a dynamic mechanism in
           which coordination is sustained by a deterrent mechanism that punishes potential
           deviators from the joint agreement to foreclose. To assess coordinated effects of this
           kind the Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines353 and well-established case law354
           require proof that the operation will make coordination more likely, more effective or
           more sustainable. The analysis needs to focus in particular on the ability to reach

   Industry characteristics pertinent to commercial foreclosure
   (395)   To understand whether the Notifying Parties would have the commercial ability to
           substantially foreclose rival mobile wallet providers, the Commission examined the
           mobile supply chain. The following are the main participants in the supply chain:
           (a)    OEMs, responsible for the hardware and software specification of the mobile
                  handsets which are supplied to the retailers;
           (b)    OS developers who supply software to OEMs and often set minimum hardware
                  requirements and control which apps run on their OS and/or the major app
                  stores where apps can be downloaded from;
           (c)    M(V)NOs as suppliers of airtime;
           (d)    Retailers of mobile handsets and airtime, both M(V)NO direct sales channels
                  and independent retailers.
   (396)   M(V)NOs either sell their airtime through their direct sales channel, that is, their own
           branded retail store or their online store, or they sell it through independent retailers
           who act as agents for the M(V)NOs for airtime. In the United Kingdom, end
           customers typically expect to acquire a new mobile handset when purchasing
           connectivity to a mobile network. Therefore, to attract customers, retailers offer
           subscribers subsidies on mobile handsets when the customers purchase mobile
           airtime. Mobile handsets are subsidised both by the direct M(V)NO sales channels as
           well as by the independent distributors. These handset subsidies are usually financed
           by part of the commission that M(V)NOs offer to the independent retailers for the
           sale of airtime contracts, although it is for the independent retailer to decide how to
           utilise his commission. It is the retailer (direct or independent) who determines the
           level of the subsidy and grants it to its customer. As discussed in Recital (44), the
           majority of mobile handsets are subsidised for post-pay (pay monthly) subscriptions,
           but subsidies for prepay subscriptions have largely been phased out. However, as
           discussed in Recital (45), the smartphones needed to run mobile payments and
           mCommerce apps are mostly (77%) sold subject to a pay monthly contract.
   (397)   M(V)NOs purchase mobile handsets from OEMs and sell them through their own
           branded retail stores or online stores. Larger independent retailers also usually
           purchase their handsets directly from OEMs. Exceptionally, smaller, non-specialised
           independent retailers (such as supermarkets) which typically sell lower-end mobile
           handsets are often supplied by the M(V)NOs. Lower-end mobile handsets would be
           unlikely to accommodate mobile wallets so these non-specialist retailers have very
           limited relevance in this case. As discussed in Recitals (42) and (43) the two largest
           independent retailers, Carphone Warehouse and Phones 4U are reported to have
           jointly a market share of up to [40-50]% on a sales value basis355.

   (398)   In the United Kingdom, mobile handsets are generally sold on a non-exclusive basis
           to all M(V)NOs and independent retailers. Exclusive supply of mobile handsets in
           the United Kingdom is rare and typically involves significant volume commitments
           to the OEM concerned. Where exclusive supply of popular mobile handsets is
           negotiated, the OEM can typically negotiate even more favourable terms of supply.
           For example, when Telefónica took exclusive supply of the Apple iPhone in the
           United Kingdom, the Notifying Parties submitted356 that it was reported that between
           [10-20]% and [40-50]% of its iPhone voice and data revenues went to Apple357. In the
           retail mobile telephony market, the MNOs compete intensely against each other, with
           the MVNOs and with the indirect channels. To win customers, each retailer needs to
           ensure that it offers consumers an attractive user experience. The independent
           retailers provide OEMs with important alternative options to dealing directly with the
           MNOs. Their mobile handsets are able to reach consumers independently of the retail
           activity of MNOs. Independent retailers are perceived as offering impartial technical
           and sales advices to consumers on mobile handsets and airtime contracts. They can
           also offer a wider range of mobile handsets than that offered by the MNOs.
   (399)   An MNO who seeks to compete without engaging indirect channels will be at a
           disadvantage. The importance of indirect retailers of MNOs can be seen by […]*358.
   (400)   The MVNOs also play an important role in the competitive environment in the
           United Kingdom. First, their inclusion in the retail mobile telephony market
           intensifies the level of competition. Second, in many cases they are an important
           alternative channel for the retail supply of mobile handsets. In 2010 Virgin Mobile
           had a consumer share of mobile connections of around 6%, Tesco Mobile had a share
           of around 5% and others had a share around 2%359.
   (401)   As discussed in Recital (36), M(V)NOs sometimes request OEMs to modify the
           specifications of mobile handsets that are purchased for sale in the direct M(V)NO
           sales channels. Depending on the volume purchased and the approach of the specific
           OEM, the OEM might agree to introduce such modifications. Independent retailers
           on the other hand do not tailor the mobile handsets they purchase from the OEMs (so
           called "vanilla" mobile handsets).
   (402)   Several very important OEMs are currently selling and developping mobile handsets
           with embeddded SEs or dual SE architecture as the standard version of the mobile
           handsets (see footnote 258). In this context, it is recalled that besides Transaction
           services, other services would most likely exist that may be better suited for mobile

          handsets equipped with an embedded SE, like access control to company's offices, or
          where a service provider needs to deliver credentials (for example hotel keys) to the
          smartphone of a traveller from another country (in this latter example, a SIM-based
          SE would not appear to be most adequate as the service providers would need to deal
          with operators globally to provide an ubiquitous service). While there are also ''world
          devices'' that can be used in any geographic area, mobile handsets appear to be often
          configured differently depending on the region in which they are ultimately sold
          (United States of America, Japan, China, European Union, etc). In some countries,
          notably the United States of America and Japan, the same SIM model is not applied.
   (403)  Moreover, each of the Notifying Parties' parent company’s purchase share of the
          global market for the mobile handsets is likely to be small360. While data on MNO’s
          purchase share of global mobile handset supply appears unavailable, their share of
          global mobile revenues could be a reasonable proxy for their share of mobile handset
          supply. A recent report found that, of the top 20 mobile operators by global revenues
          in 2011, none of the Notifying Parties’ parent companies had a share of revenues
          greater than 10%. Given that there are likely to be a long tail of mobile operators
          outside the top 20, the actual share of global revenues of each parent operator (on a
          consolidated basis) is likely to be significantly lower than 10% (the share of revenues
          of the top 20 Mobile Operators for each parent Group was: Vodafone 9.9%;
          Telefónica 7.9%; Deutsche Telecom 6% and France Telecom 5.3%). Therefore, none
          of the Notifying Parties parent company is likely to be able to exert much bargaining
          power in their relationship with OEMs361.
   (404)  Mobile handsets play an important role in generating sales of airtime contracts.
          Retailers have to offer the latest "must have" mobile handsets. There is a limited
          number of such mobile handsets. Consumers increasingly demand high specification
          mobile handsets which are often marketed directly to the public by manufacturers.
          Relatively few mobile handsets tend to account for the vast majority of the market.
          This means that in order to compete effectively, retailers (whether the MNOs or
          MVNOs directly or indirect retailers) have to stock these "must offer" mobile
          handsets. According to […]*, the top ten contract mobile handsets sold in the second
          quarter of 2011 accounted for 62% of all contract mobile handset sales. The most
          popular contract mobile handsets in 2011 Q2 were the […]*362.
   (405)  The OS is a key component for smartphones363. OEMs either develop their own OS
          or they license it from an OS developer. The number and variety of apps that is
          available for an OS is one of the key dimensions of competition in the retail mobile
          telephony market. Apps are either pre-installed on the mobile handset when it is

           provider situation:
           (a)    Apple is a vertically integrated supplier of mobile OS (iOs), mobile handsets
                   (iPhone and iPad), a mobile application marketplace (Apple App Store) as well
                   as mobile apps (for example FaceTime, iPhoto, iBooks). IPhone or iPad users
                   are required to open an iTunes store account when activating their mobile
                   handsets, providing card details;
           (b)    Google controls the Android OS, which runs over the majority of non-Apple
                   smartphones in the United Kingdom365 and the Google suite of mobile apps
                   including Google Play (which includes the former Android Market), YouTube,
                   Google Maps and Google Search. Google controls the development of the
                   Android OS, the terms on which handsets can use the Android OS and the
                   Google app;
           (c)    RIM is another vertically integrated provider of mobile services controlling
                   both the hardware and software (RIM OS) of its own BlackBerry mobile
                   handsets;
           (d)    Microsoft has developed the Windows Phone OS to replace its previous
                   Windows Mobile OS. The Windows Phone has its own app store, the Windows
                   Phone Marketplace. Microsoft has a range of services including its own search
                   engine (Bing), map provider (Bing Maps), web browser (Internet explorer) and
                   media player (Zune366).
   (407)   With the rise of smartphones, some market power has shifted further from the
           M(V)NOs to the OS providers and consumers.
   (408)   Attracting smartphone users appears also to be key to the development of M(V)NOs'
           business. In particular, smartphones have allowed M(V)NOs to attract consumers
           with higher average revenue per user and thus to monetise the development of
           additional services (like mobile data services)367 in a way that was not possible

           mobile handset. Now, customers choose a "mobile ecosystem" which includes:
           mobile handsets with sophisticated hardware capabilities, OSs which enable fast,
           easy-to-use and customisable user interfaces on those mobile handsets, and an app
           store which offers a wide range of services which enable consumers to personalise
           their mobile handset to reflect their needs. OEMs have to cater for smartphone users
           who expect to be able to seamlessly switch between multiple activities on a single
           mobile handset (access the internet, send and receive emails and messages, access
           social networks, use their music and video player, use satellite navigation, manage
           their contacts database, and take and publish pictures or videos).

   (411)   As new uses for mobile handsets evolve, because of changing technology or demand,
           consumers expect to be able to quickly and easily incorporate new apps onto their
           preferred mobile handset. In this regard, mobile handsets which provide open access
           to app stores have become an important part of retail competition in the supply of
           mobile handsets. Customers choose mobile handsets which can access well stocked
           app stores as consumers seek to tailor their mobile handsets to their needs. For
           example, Apple’s app store was launched in 2008 and hosted over 500,000 apps by
           October 2011. Android Market launched in 2008 and had about 400,000 apps from
           around 100,000 developers by January 2012369. Consumers' changing relationship
           with their smartphone is underlined by research from Ofcom who reported: “There
           has been a huge growth in smartphone take-up in past 12 months [during 2010].
           Over a quarter (27%) of UK adults are smartphone users …The Apple iPhone is the
           most popular brand overall, but BlackBerry handsets are the most popular choice
           among younger consumers…Smartphone users have a much stronger relationship
           with their phone than standard mobile phone users, with 37% admitting high levels
           of ‘addiction’ to their phone (scoring seven or more out of ten), compared to 12% of
           standard mobile handset users”370.
   (412)   Research by Telefónica highlighted […]*371.
   (413)   Any attempts by the MNOs to introduce a mobile "walled garden" model usually
           meet strong consumer resistance. With the use of social networks, blogs and other
           consumer comments and review websites, consumer dissatisfaction can gain wide
           traction and cause damage to MNOs' reputation. […]*372, […]*.
   (414)   IPhone and Android OS mobile handsets, in particular, have succeeded in providing
           feature-rich mobile handsets which allow users to customise their experience. Google
           and Apple’s success in supplying smartphones which consumers value is seen in
           their market shares; by November 2011, 72%373 of all mobile handsets supplied were
           either Apple or Android.
   (415)   Therefore, it appears that consumers have quickly grown accustomed to
           personalising their mobile handsets by downloading apps, etc. Consumers are likely
           to react in a negative manner to having their choice of services on their smartphones

           consumer review and comment websites, any such adverse reaction would likely
           gain wider media coverage which could cause damage to the Notifying Parties’
           brand and reputation. Consumers do not appear to favour having their mobile
           experience shaped by their MNO.
   Routes to commercial foreclosure
   (416)   The Commission has examined several potential routes to commercial foreclosure
           ordered along the different steps of the value chain which the Commission considers
           as the most likely potential routes to commercial foreclosure in the market
           investigation. It is important to bear in mind that strategies listed below are not
           mutually exclusive and could be used in combination with each other. The
           Commission examined the following:
           (a)   Whether the Notifying Parties could exercise commercial pressure on OEMs
                  not to install or to block the pre-installed embedded SE;
           (b)    Whether the Notifying Parties have the commercial ability to influence OS
                  developers or OEMs to block/remove the preloading of mobile wallet apps;
           (c)   Whether the Notifying Parties could disadvantage or delist handsets capable of
                  supporting rival wallets;
           (d)   Whether the Notifying Parties would be able to incentivise independent
                  retailers to market handsets that do not contain rival wallets or to set certain
                  default settings which favour their wallet.
   (417)   In this section, the Commission analyses, for each route of commercial foreclosure,
           whether the Notifying Parties have the ability and the incentive to engage in a joint
           commercial foreclosure strategy. In addition, the Commission analyses whether the
           Notifying Parties together with banks would have the ability and the incentive to
           substantially foreclose non-bank payment solutions.
   (418)   It is important to bear in mind that the assessment of the different foreclosure
           strategies discussed in this section is based on the narrowest market definition,
           concentrating only on mobile wallets that work on NFC technology as discussed in
           section 8.1.3. If additional types of payment methods were to be included in the
           relevant market and therefore in the assessment of foreclosure (for example NFC
           payment cards or NFC credit cards, non-NFC mobile payment methods such as the
           Apple Passbook that provides voucher and loyalty card functionality) it would be
           even less likely that the operation would raise foreclosure concerns.
   (419)   As Apple currently does not offer NFC enabled mobile handsets or mobile wallets,
           the Commission has assessed the likelihood of foreclosure assuming that Apple will
           not be active as a provider of NFC-based mobile wallet services, at least in the short
           term. […]*. Market participants, however, expect that Apple could enter that market
           should it wish to do so. Apple currently already offers mobile wallet related services
           within "Apple Passbook", a digital card carrier for loyalty cards, event tickets or
           airline boarding passes. The Commission expects that in case the NFC mobile
           wallet market passes

           the nascency phase and if the mobile wallet ecosystem is widely adopted by
           consumers and merchants alike, it would induce entry by players such as Apple.
           Using all available evidence, indicating the unique market position that Apple
           enjoys, the Commission considers that the Notifying Parties would not be in a
           position in any event to foreclose Apple in such circumstances. This is relevant to the
           competitive assessment of the operation, as it is set out below.
   Commercial pressure on OEMs not to install or to block the pre-installed embedded SE
   (420)   The Commission has examined whether the Notifying Parties would have the ability
           and the incentive to put commercial pressure on OEMs not to install an embedded
           SE on their mobile handset models, or to block a pre-installed embedded SE. The
           Commission has examined the Notifying Parties' commercial influence in relation to
           mobile handsets sourced by the Notifying Parties themselves for distribution through
           their direct sales channels and also in relation to "vanilla" mobile handsets sourced
           by independent retailers.
   The view of the Notifying Parties
   (421)   The Notifying Parties submit that they would not request OEMs not to install or to
           block or disable the pre-installed mobile handset embedded SE (which could carry a
           competing mobile wallet), as it would not be in their interest to reduce the appeal of
           its handsets by removing or disabling functionalities that customers may want, and
           this may require the consent of other players in the mobile supply chain who would
           have the power to resist such attempt (notably Google with its Android OS). In
           addition, they submit that they already sell or plan to sell a number of mobile
           handsets containing embedded SEs in the United Kingdom; this proves that they do
           not intend to require handset manufacturers to remove or block embedded SEs.
   (422)   Regarding all commercial foreclosure strategies considered by the Commission, the
           Notifying Parties submit that they would not have unilateral incentives to engage in a
           joint foreclosure strategy. Among other things this is due to the fact that there is a
           large asymmetry between the potential gains in the mobile wallet market and the
           potential losses in the retail mobile telephony market. In particular, the gains would
           accrue in the mobile wallet market which is relatively small in terms of expected
           revenues and expected margins; the losses however would occur in the much larger
           retail mobile telephony market. Moreover, the cost of any foreclosure strategy would
           also be high due to counterstrategies that would be expected in case of foreclosure
           which would be employed by rival mobile wallet providers. As a result, the risk of
           engaging in unilateral foreclosure would be too high for the Notifying Parties.
   (423)   Moreover, the Notifying Parties submit that they would not have the ability to reach
           and monitor an agreement to engage in coordinated foreclosure for any commercial
           foreclosure strategies considered by the Commission. Among other things, this is due
           to the fact that it would be difficult for the Notifying Parties to reach a common
           agreement as there is a lack of transparency over the bi-lateral commercial
           agreements on which commercial coordinated foreclosure strategy would depend,
           and a lack of a focal point on the various potential commercial foreclosure strategies.
           Moreover, the parties to such an agreement would have an incentive to deviate as
           punishment mechanisms would not be sufficiently costly to deter deviation. External
           stability would be undermined as players outside the JV Co, could easily disrupt any
EN                                              96                                                 EN

         collusive agreement between the Notifying Parties. Overall, the Notifying Parties
         therefore conclude that they would not have the ability or the incentive to engage in a
         coordinated commercial foreclosure strategy.
   The Commission's assessment
   (424) M(V)NOs control the decision of which mobile handsets they distribute through their
         own-branded shops; and they may request OEMs to tailor a handset for these direct
         sales. It is at the sole discretion of the M(V)NO which mobile handsets they select
         for direct sales. Moreover, a number of OEMs have indicated that they would make
         modifications to specific handset models if requested by an MNO for direct sales.
   (425) A number of OEMs have responded to the Commission's questions during the market
         investigation that MNOs sometimes seek to buy a specific "operator variant" of a
         given mobile handset sold in their own MNO retailer channels. Thus some features
         may differ in the "operator variant" mobile handset, depending on the wishes of the
         MNO as to the features that need to be supported by the mobile handset and that they
         are willing to support as preloaded content. However, these features (such as an
         embedded SE) would be available in the "vanilla variant" open-market mobile
         handset, which would be available to independent retailers, subject to technical
         certification by MNOs. This technical certification is given by MNOs to all mobile
         handsets that are technically compatible with its network and is not impacted by
         commercial considerations. This is evidenced by the fact that NFC-enabled mobile
         handsets with an embedded SE (which could carry a competing mobile wallet) are
         already being widely stocked by the Notifying Parties (see Recital (267)) as well as
         by the independent retailers in the United Kingdom.
   (426) A notable exception is Apple which does not offer operator variants. The design of
         the iPhone does not vary by geography and there are no different versions of the
         same mobile handset. Apple works with MNOs to ensure that the new mobile
         handset model will work on their networks and will share general information with
         MNOs. Apple retains control of the design process. MNOs only influence the design
         process to the extent that the mobile handset must be compatible with their networks.
         The Notifying Parties would therefore not be able to substantially foreclose Apple
         from the wallet market if Apple were to decide to enter.
   (427) On this basis, the Notifying Parties could in theory request OEMs to remove or block
         the pre-installed embedded SE on the mobile handsets sourced for their own direct,
         own-brand retail channel. However, OS providers or fully vertically integrated
         OEMs could engage in counterstrategies against such an attempt to foreclose. OS
         providers are involved much earlier than the MNOs in the development process of a
         mobile handset and this limits the extent of the influence the Notifying Parties have
         on the mobile handset specifications compared to the OS providers. An OS provider
         anticipating any such request by the Notifying Parties could try to influence OEMs'
         mobile handset specifications early on by making it mandatory that any OS branded
         mobile handset has a functioning embedded SE on the mobile handset. This would
         be the case in particular for Google, whose control over Android gives it a strong
EN                                              97                                               EN

           position in possible negotiations with OEMs374. Google's position in the market for
           the supply of handsets is becoming increasingly important as the proportion of
           mobile handset sales that use Android has grown significantly over time. In the
           period of 2010-2011, Android mobile handsets in the United Kingdom have
           increased their share from below [5-10]% to around [40-50]%375. Fully vertically
           integrated OEMs that would offer a rival wallet over an embedded SE could also
           ensure that the hardware of the mobile handset was fully compatible with the
           operation of their mobile wallet376.
   (428)   Financial institutions could also choose to offer NFC contactless payments
           functionality, either by partnering with an OTT provider (for example Google)
           through access to an embedded SE, or on its own using micro SDs or stickers /
           sleeves (even though these solutions are considered somewhat less convenient377).
           The existence of these alternative channels demonstrates that any attempt by the
           Notifying Parties to substantially foreclose rival mobile wallets offered by financial
           institutions would be ineffective.
   (429)   Moreover, any ability to commercially foreclose based on the blocking or disabling
           of the embedded SE would in any event be limited in scope, and at least partially
           ineffective. The commercial ability of the Notifying Parties to block or disable the
           pre-installed embedded SEs would only lead to partial foreclosure of rival mobile
           wallets as the Notifying Parties would not have the ability and incentives to

         See the Commission decision of 13 February 2012 in Case No COMP/M.6381 Google / Motorola
         Mobility, paragraphs 68 to 70. Besides, even if Google is moving in the hardware business, independent
         experts confirm that: “Despite the open philosophy on which Android was first introduced, there has
         been a steady trend of Google becoming more controlling over the platform. This was initially through
         the release of its own-branded Nexus devices, which it has used to showcase the latest release of
         Android, but this has been followed by its refusal to open source the code for the tablet-optimized
         Honeycomb version of Android. There have also been reports of Google being more selective as to
         which OEMs it provides with early access to the latest releases of the Android source code, essentially
         creating a select club of OEMs which must stay close to Google in order to keep at the leading edge of
         technological development. Google maintains a number of proprietary control points over the "open"
         OS, such as the trademark to the term "Android", in addition to the core Google-branded apps on the
         device, such as Google Mail, Maps, and Android Marketplace. Additionally, the Apache 2.0 open
         source license which Google has chosen for Android means that it is not legally obliged to release the
         source code, which is why it was able to keep the Honeycomb code private. These factors mean that
         OEMs must maintain a close relationship with Google and have the company's blessing in order to
         access the source code, use its popular services, and use the Android brand on their devices. With this
         in mind, it is clear that Google is not only keen to exert more control over who uses Android, but also
         how they use it. The company has clearly seen the benefits that greater control and vertical integration
         can bring, by watching the value of its close competitor Apple rise, and may be keen to also tap into the
         benefits of becoming more vertically integrated." Ovum's report, page.6, attached as Annex 4 to the

         Blackberry mobile handset manufacturer RIM has recently announced that developing NFC apps will
         be a priority for its Blackberry smartphones and stated that "NFC will be a big push for RIM for the
         next 12 months" (see http://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethwoyke/2011/11/08/rim-plans-big-push-for-
         nfc-enabled-blackberry-apps/). The Commission however takes note of the evolving situation of RIM,
         which appears to go through some restructuring measures. Blackberry likely possesses the necessary
         power in the mobile supply chain to ensure a route to the market for its popular mobile handsets.
         According to […]*, three of the top ten handsets for post-pay customers in Q1 2012 in the United
         Kingdom were Blackberry mobile handsets (see the Notifying Parties' submission "No commercial
         ability to foreclose rival wholesale mobile wallet platform services", page 35).

          substantially foreclose the indirect retail channel (as is set out in detail in Recital
          (487)). Independent retailers have a strong position in the market with up to 49%
          market share and 41% of the number of retail stores in the United Kingdom.
          According to a Mintel Report378 Phones 4U and Carphone Warehouse collectively
          have 1,258 stores. This compares to Everything Everywhere with 672 stores,
          Telefónica with 450 stores and Vodafone with 365 stores. Three UK has another 300
          stores in the United Kingdom.
   (430)  This argument also applies to other commercial strategies of the Notifying Parties to
          foreclose which were presented above in Recitals (416)(b) and (416)(c).
   (431)  The Commission therefore concludes that the Notifying Parties' commercial ability
          to foreclose by exerting commercial pressure on OEMs to block or de-activate the
          pre-installed embedded SE would at most lead to partial foreclosure (excluding
          Apple mobile handsets and the indirect retailers). Moreover, it may fail altogether if
          OS providers were able to implement effective counterstrategies which would
          prevent the Notifying Parties from blocking the functioning of embedded SEs.
   (432)  The fact that the commercial strategy to foreclose based on not installing or blocking
          the embedded SE only leads to a limited ability to foreclose also impacts the
          unilateral incentives to foreclose.
   (433)  Firstly, as this strategy would only lead to partial foreclosure it would considerably
          limit the effectiveness and would - even if used - significantly reduce the incentives
          to engage in such a strategy, since the incremental profits from foreclosure would be
          limited. This is reinforced by the strong asymmetry that exists between the expected
          profits of the JV Co and the profits in the retail mobile telephony market, as
          highlighted by the Notifying Parties. In particular, gross profits for the retail mobile
          telephony activities of the Notifying Parties (including interconnection profits, and
          net of customer acquisitions costs) are roughly about […]* times higher than
          the expected profits of the JV Co after its initial ramping-up period379.
   (434)  Secondly, the Notifying Parties have also shown that competitive conditions in the
          markets for advertising and data analytics differ significantly from those in the
          wholesale mobile wallet market. Moreover, revenues and profits for these two
          activities are not directly linked to the Transaction activities of the JV Co, and would
          not be directly affected by a strategy that forecloses rival mobile wallet operators.
          This is in particular due to the fact that there are currently already existing
          competitors or potential new entrants in both the advertising and data analytics
          markets (offering the same or similar services to the JV Co) who will constrain the
          JV Co to a sufficient extent (See sections 9.4.4 and 9.4.5). This implies that the
          potential profits from foreclosure which would mainly accrue in the Transaction
          market (instead of across the entire range of the activities of the JV Co) would be
          even smaller in magnitude compared with the potential losses in the retail mobile
          telephony market, making it even less likely that the Notifying Parties would have
          incentives to engage in the commercial foreclosure strategy considered here.

           markets380 (excluding advertising and data analytics) and the profits in the retail
           mobile telephony market would be about […]*381.
   (435)  Thirdly, adverse consumer reaction to the impairment of rival mobile wallet offers
           represents the primary mechanism through which commercial foreclosure would lead
           to losses in the retail mobile telephony market. Consumers would react adversely to
           foreclosure either because they value rival mobile wallets more and therefore decide
           to switch to a rival mobile wallet provider offered on a competing mobile platform
           (for example by Three UK or one of the M(V)NOs), or because consumers react to
           the negative publicity that would be triggered as a result of foreclosure. Consumers
           may also switch to alternative payment methods which constrain retail mobile
           wallets (including both offline and online alternatives), as discussed in the market
           definition section (see section 8.1.3). An example of how a restriction in consumer
           choice can lead to slow uptake and adverse consumer reaction is […]*.
   (436)  Fourthly, competitors could engage in counter-strategies aimed at increasing adverse
           consumer reaction. These counterstrategies would make rival mobile wallets
           attractive to customers thereby increasing the cost of foreclosure. Such
           counterstrategies could take the form of increasing the product differentiation
           between the JV CO and rival mobile wallets by investing in branding and marketing.
           Moreover, customers could be directly targeted by offering free credits for the
           adoption of the rival mobile wallet. An example of this is Google Wallet which in the
           United States of America offered USD 50 worth of credit for consumers choosing
           their mobile wallet services.
   (437)  Lastly, if one of the Notifying Parties wanted to unilaterally deviate from the
           common foreclosure strategy based on pressure on OEMs not to install or to block
           the pre-installed embedded SE, it would have the ability to stock or promote a range
           of fully functional mobile handsets, and have a faster time-to-market for mobile
           handsets compared to the foreclosing Notifying Parties. Given that some mobile
           handsets are considered as "must-have", limiting the sale of these mobile handsets
           would be a risky and costly strategy for each of the Notifying Parties.
   (438)  These factors, taken together, mean that commercial foreclosure would be associated
           with significant incentives for any Notifying Party to deviate from the conduct, so as
           to avoid any adverse consumer reaction to the impairment of their mobile offer, and
           to gain an advantage over the other Notifying Parties which would engage in
           foreclosure. Any Notifying Party deviating from foreclosure would also avoid a loss
           of market share to the M(V)NOs outside of the JV Co.
   (439)  The Commission has assessed the submission of the Notifying Parties whereby at
           least one of them would only need to grow its retail sales by a very small amount

           (about [0-5]%) in order to have a unilateral incentive to deviate from a hypothetical
           joint foreclosure strategy. This critical growth level assumes that foreclosure would
           result in symmetric switching away from the foreclosing Notifying Parties towards
           the deviating Notifying Party and other parties that would support rival mobile wallet
           operators, for example Three UK and MVNOs. This calculation is based on the
           assumption that the Notifying Parties would increase their profits in the Transaction
           market by [50-60]% as a result of foreclosure. This would represent a significant
           increase in the profits from mobile wallet activities, given that commercial
           foreclosure would be partial for the reasons explained above382. This computation
           also assumes that the [50-60]% increase in profits in the Transaction market would
           translate into an associated increase in profits in the data analytics and advertising
           services (due to higher transaction volumes), resulting in an overall increase in profits
           for the JV Co of about [30-40]%383.
   (440)   Overall, it appears very likely that at least one of the Notifying Parties would have a
           unilateral incentive to deviate from any a joint commercial foreclosure strategy
           predicated on exerting pressure on OEMs to block the pre-installed embedded SE.
           This would undermine a joint commercial foreclosure strategy.
   (441)   Concerning a joint foreclosure strategy based on tacit and on-going coordination
           between the Notifying Parties, it is unlikely that all of the conditions laid down in the
           Airtours judgment384 would be met in the case of commercial foreclosure. The
           following Recitals (442) to (450) discuss the incentives of the JV Co to engage in
           tacit coordination.
   (442)   Firstly, coordinated commercial foreclosure would be complex to implement given
           that it depends on the outcome of bilateral negotiations between each Notifying Party
           and third parties which are confidential and which depend on the bargaining power
           of each party in the negotiations.
   (443)   Secondly, coordinated foreclosure may not be internally stable, since the unilateral
           gains from deviation may exceed the cost of punishment following the collapse of
           the coordinated outcome. Given the significant asymmetry between retail mobile
           telephony profits and the JV Co’s expected profits in the Transaction activities, the
           threat of punishment may not be sufficient to outweigh the incentive to deviate.
           Moreover, deviations from coordination would likely only be detected with a lag in
           this market, since commercial negotiations are confidential and deviation would only
           be detected once the mobile handset comes on the market. This would further
           undermine the effectiveness of any punishment mechanism, making a collusive
           agreement even more difficult to sustain.
   (444)   A related point is that deviation by one of the Notifying Parties is likely to be
           irreversible in the sense that once the consumer has a particular feature on his or her
           mobile handset, this feature will stay on the mobile handset until the consumer
           decides to buy a new mobile handset. Furthermore, as pointed out by the Notifying
   382
         It should be noted that this is a cautious assumption given that it increases the likelihood that
         foreclosure of rival mobile wallet providers would be profitable.

          Parties, it is likely that there is significant adverse consumer reaction to the roll-back
          of new and enhanced functionality that is offered in the market (see Recital (413)).
          Irreversibility therefore commits the deviating firm to keeping the new feature on the
          market. In particular, given that the post-pay contract length associated with
          smartphones is typically about two years in the United Kingdom (see Recital (44)), a
          deviating firm would capture switching customers for a relatively long time period.
          This would give the deviating firm a head start compared to the foreclosing
          Notifying Parties that could lead to a more persistent shift in market shares towards
          the deviating Notifying Party to the detriment of the foreclosing Notifying Parties.
          This would increase the incentive to deviate from the coordinated outcome and
          would destabilize tacit collusion.
   (445)  Thirdly, rival mobile wallet providers, such as Google, could also deploy
          counterstrategies targeted at the possibility of coordinated foreclosure, with the aim
          of increasing the incentives to deviate for each Notifying Party (and therefore
          undermine internal stability). Counterstrategies could take the form of offering
          temporary exclusivity on a specific mobile handset to a Notifying Party that would
          deviate from the agreement. This temporary exclusivity offer could be combined
          with a volume commitment imposed on the deviating Notifying Party which would
          guarantee that the MNO would be incentivized to achieve the required sales target385.
          The cost of such counterstrategies to a rival mobile wallet provider would therefore
          be limited while having a considerable adverse impact on the foreclosing Notifying
          Parties as they would lose market shares to the deviating Notifying Party (this
          counterstrategy also applies to all commercial foreclosure mechanisms discussed in
          Recitals (416)(b) to (416)(d)).(416)(b)
   (446)  Fourthly, the existence of effective counterstrategies would also undermine the
          external stability of the outcome of the potential coordinated foreclosure. M(V)NOs
          outside of the JV Co could negotiate preferential terms with rival mobile wallet
          providers, OEMs or retailers. OTT players, Three UK or financial institutions could
          start offering their own mobile wallets in the United Kingdom either by themselves
          or in collaboration with each other. Moreover, if the price level (for example for
          access fees or for renting space on SE) were to rise as a result of foreclosure this
          would likely induce entry by integrated players such as Apple. This would also
          increase the attractiveness of alternative competing mobile payment methods offered
          by external players such as NFC-enabled payment cards or "PayPal InStore" (see
          Recital ((47)(b)).
   (447)  Fifthly, regardless of the existence of counterstrategies, the Notifying Parties would
          lose retail mobile telephony market shares to rival mobile wallet providers as a result
          of adverse consumer reaction to foreclosure as discussed in Recital (436). External
          competitors may therefore be able to disrupt the coordinated equilibrium by
          capturing a sufficiently high share of the retail mobile telephony market or of the JV
          Co’s related markets from the Notifying Parties.
   (448)  Given the asymmetry between profits from retail mobile telephony market and those
          from the JV Co, undertakings outside the JV Co (for example Three UK, and
          MNVOs) would only need to grow their retail mobile sales by a small percentage of
   385

           the market in order to make coordinated foreclosure unprofitable (relative to a
           competitive outcome with no foreclosure) for at least one of the Notifying Parties.
           Three UK and the MVNOs active in the United Kingdom would be able to profit
           from a commercial foreclosure strategy by the Notifying Parties, since they could
           support rival mobile wallet offerings on their mobile handsets. The Notifying Parties
           have calculated the critical loss of market shares to Three UK and MVNOs that
           would make foreclosure unprofitable for the JV Co as a whole. They submit that a
           combined market share gain of the undertakings outside of the JV Co of about [0-
           5]%point would be enough to make foreclosure unprofitable for the Notifying
           Parties386. This would translate into […]*. The Commission considers that such
           growth rate is most likely within reach of these undertakings. Again, as outlined in
           Recital (439), it is assumed in this numerical example that foreclosure would increase
           the JV Co's mobile wallet transaction profits by [50-60]% and overall JV Co's profits
           (including Transaction profits, advertising profits and data analytics profits) by [30-
           40]%. The Commission has carefully analysed the various economic submissions
           from the Notifying Parties387 and considers the approach to be realistic.
   (449)   These calculations would even result in lower critical growth rates for undertakings
           outside of the JV Co if one takes a dynamic perspective. In particular, whilst Three
           UK has a relatively small share of the overall retail mobile telephony market in the
           United Kingdom (9.5% roughly), its share of post-pay smartphone connections is
           considerably higher [10-20%]388. The market share in post-pay smartphone
           connections is more indicative for the current analysis as the mobile wallets would
           be rolled out on high-end smart-phones, typically linked to post-pay contracts.
           Moreover, it provides a better picture of future market shares, given the
           continuing growth of smartphones in the market.
   (450)   Overall, based on the above analysis, the Commission concludes that it is very
           unlikely that the Notifying Parties would have the ability and the incentive to engage
           in a joint foreclosure strategy that would entail putting commercial pressure on
           OEMs to block the pre-installed embedded SE which could support a rival mobile
           wallet.
   Influence over OS developers or OEMs to block mobile wallet apps
   (451)   The Commission has examined whether the Notifying Parties would have the ability
           and the incentive to influence OS developers or OEMs to block the preloading of, or
           to remove, mobile wallet apps on mobile handsets. In the discussion on technical
           foreclosure in Recitals (294) to,(313) the Commission concluded that the Notifying
           Parties would not have the ability to technically foreclose the downloading of a rival
           mobile wallet app on a mobile handset. In this section, the Commission considers
           whether the Notifying Parties could commercially restrict the pre-loading of a mobile
   386
          This assumes that the undertakings outside of the JV Co have an approximate retail mobile telephony
          market share of about [10-20]% and that the ratio of retail margins compared to the JV Co margins is
          […]*. Three UK achieved a subscriber growth rate of 12.4% in 2010. See Form CO, paragraph 872.

           wallet app on a mobile handset, and by doing so, foreclose rival mobile wallet
           providers.
   The view of the Notifying Parties
   (452)   The Notifying Parties argue that any potential rival mobile wallet provider which
           also controls an OS (such as Google and Apple) would be able to ensure that its
           mobile wallet app was available to download from their app store.
   (453)   They add that, even if the JV Co were to develop a mobile wallet platform that could
           technically be installed on a mobile handset, this mobile wallet would not be
           preloaded on open market handsets sold by independent retailers for the following
           reasons, which are the same reasons that the Notifying Parties' mobile wallets will
           not be preloaded:
           (a)    retailers will not know which airtime contract the user will buy with the mobile
                  handset , or whether they will buy a contract with the mobile handset at all;
           (b)    generally, it would also not be feasible for the retailer to open the mobile
                  handset packaging, preload certain apps, and then sell it to customers.
   (454)   The Notifying Parties submit that competitors such as Google or Apple could pre-
           install their mobile wallet app on mobile handsets, including on “open market”
           mobile handsets. These mobile wallets are not country or network operator specific.
           Thus, they have an advantage in this respect over the Notifying Parties.
   (455)   As discussed in Recitals (422) to (423), the Notifying Parties submit that they also
           would not have the incentives to engage in either unilateral or coordinated
           foreclosure.
   The Commission's assessment
   (456)   On the basis of the market investigation, the Commission concludes that the
           Notifying Parties cannot prevent users from downloading apps. This is set out in
           detail in Recitals (294) to(313).
   (457)   A number of respondents to the questions raised during the market investigation
           highlighted the importance of pre-loading an app and noted that the Notifying Parties
           could influence where a specific app sits on the handset screen in their "operator
           variant" mobile handsets.
   (458)   However, rival mobile wallet providers would be able to take countermeasures,
           promoting the placement of their mobile wallets in a prominent location in the app
           store. Moreover, OS providers could also tie the mobile wallet app to the OS in
           anticipation of requests to OEMs. In particular, such a counterstrategy may be
           implemented by Google, who, for instance, has the ability to influence software
           choices via their mobile app distribution agreements with OEMs that stipulate which
           of the Google mobile suite of apps are pre-loaded onto a mobile handset. The
           potential effectiveness of such a strategy is also reflected in the influence Google
           currently has on the mobile OS market (see Recital (414))
EN                                               104                                               EN

   (459)  The Commission also notes that Microsoft states that the Microsoft wallet will be
          preloaded on all Windows Phones. Every version of a Windows Phone will be
          provided with a version of the mobile wallet (even if not all of them will necessarily
          be used for payment instruments)389.
   (460)  Moreover, as stated by the Notifying Parties, OEMs (in particular those selling must-
          have mobile handsets and integrated OEMs) could also engage in retaliatory
          blocking of the JV Co mobile wallet as a counterstrategy.
   (461)  Similar to the commercial strategy discussed above, a commercial foreclosure
          strategy based on pressuring OEMs not to install or to block the pre-installed
          embedded SE would only lead to partial foreclosure as it could only be implemented
          on the direct retail channel that is controlled by the Notifying Parties.
   (462)  Overall, given the limited effectiveness of commercial forelcosure based on
          pressuring OEMs not to install or to block the pre-installed embedded SE and the
          strength of counterstrategies by rival mobile wallet providers, it is unlikely that the
          Notifying Parties have the commercial ability to substantially foreclose by blocking
          rival mobile wallet apps.
   (463)  In this recital and the Recitals (464) to (465) below, the Commission considers the
          incentives (both unilateral and coordinated) of the Notifying Parties’ to engage in a
          commercial foreclosure strategy based on influencing OS developers or OEMs to
          block competing mobile wallets. The majority of incentive arguments that apply to
          the first commercial foreclosure strategy discussed in the section on foreclosure by
          pressuring OEMs not to install or to block the pre-installed embedded SE (see
          Recitals (432) to (450)) also apply to a commercial strategy based on influencing OS
          developers or OEMs to block mobile wallets. In particular, the following arguments
          apply:
          (a)   Foreclosure would only be partial since influencing OS developers or OEMs to
                block mobile wallets would only be effective on the segment of the direct
                channel that is controlled by the Notifying Parties. This would reduce the
                incentive to engage in such a commercial foreclosure strategy;
          (b)   The incentives to substantially foreclose are also reduced due to the fact there
                is a strong asymmetry between the expected profits of the JV Co (where the
                gains from foreclosure would be realised) and the retail mobile telephony
                market (where losses from foreclosure would occur, due to customers
                switching to competitors);
          (c)   As competitive conditions differ between the Transaction markets and the two

           (d)    Adverse consumer reaction to foreclosure would lead to losses in the retail
                  mobile telephony market. This implies that a Notifying Party could win
                  customers by deviating from a joint foreclosure strategy, as it would stock a
                  fully functional range of handsets. The Notifying Parties would therefore have
                  significant incentives to deviate from a foreclosure strategy in order to avoid
                  adverse consumer reaction and potential loss of market shares to parties outside
                  the JV Co.
   (464)   Regarding a joint foreclosure strategy based on tacit coordination, as in the previous
           foreclosure strategy, it seems unlikely that the conditions laid down in the Airtours
           judgment are met. Coordination on a joint commercial strategy related to OS
           developers or OEMs to block mobile wallet apps would be difficult to implement
           given that it depends on bilateral negotiations between each Notifying Party and OS
           providers or OEMs (see Recital (442)). Coordinated foreclosure may also not be
           internally stable since unilateral gains from deviation may exceed the expected costs
           of punishment (see Recital (443)). Third, due to the irreversibility of deviation,
           coordination would become less stable as gains from deviations would be larger and
           punishment would be less severe (see Recital (444)). Moreover, rival mobile wallet
           providers such as OTTs or integrated OEMs could implement counterstrategies
           which would harm the Notifying Parties while at the same time would not entail
           significant costs to the parties engaging in the counterstrategies. These
           counterstrategies would also likely undermine the external stability of coordination
           (see Recital (445)-(446)). Moreover, the adverse consumer reaction would enable
           competitors to disrupt coordination by capturing sufficiently high market shares from
           the Notifying Parties. The Notifying Parties submit that the parties outside the JV Co
           would need to grow their retail mobile telephony sales by about [5-10]% in order to
           make foreclosure unprofitable (see Recital (448)). The Commission has carefully
           analysed the various economic submissions from the Notifying Parties390 and
           considers the approach to be realistic.
   (465)   On the basis of the above analysis, the Commission concludes that it is very unlikely
           that the Notifying Parties would have the ability and the incentive to engage in a joint
           foreclosure strategy that would be based on influencing OS developers or OEMs to
           block mobile wallet apps.
   Disadvantage or delist mobile handsets that contain rival mobile wallets
   (466)   The Commission has examined whether the Notifying Parties would have the ability
           and the incentive to disadvantage or delist mobile handsets capable of supporting
           rival mobile wallets.
   Views of the Notifying Parties
   (467)   The Notifying Parties accept that they control their own retail channels and therefore
           have the commercial ability to determine the range of mobile handsets that they stock
           on their retail channels. However, the Notifying Parties submit that they will have
           limited commercial ability to influence the sourcing of mobile handsets by
           independent retailers.

   (468)  Besides, the JV Co has no role in deciding which mobile handsets the Notifying
          Parties choose to range. […]*391, […]*.
   (469)  As discussed in Recitals (422) to (423), the Notifying Parties also submit that they
          would not have the incentives to engage in either unilateral or coordinated
          foreclosure.
   The Commission's assessment
   (470)  Three UK raised concerns that the JV Co could engage in commercial foreclosure by
          not distributing smartphones that include embedded SEs392. Given that the delisted or
          disadvantaged mobile handsets that may contain rival mobile wallets will have an
          alternative route to the market through the independent retailers, MNOs delisting or
          disadvantaging mobile handsets with embedded SEs on their own retail network will
          only partially foreclose. In addition, such a strategy will have a high commercial
          cost. As discussed in Recital (436), competitors could engage in counterstrategies
          that would make rival mobile wallets attractive to customers which would increase
          the cost of foreclosure.
   (471)  Delisting of mobile handsets carrying rival mobile wallets would imply that these
          mobile handsets would not be stocked anymore in the direct retail channel controlled
          by the Notifying Parties. Disadvantaging of mobile handsets carrying rival mobile
          wallets would be a more subtle form of foreclosure based on reducing the subsidies
          paid on such mobile handsets in the direct retail channel controlled by the Notifying
          Parties.
   (472)  In the Recitals (472) to (474) , the Commission considers the incentives (both
          unilateral and coordinated) of the Notifying Parties to engage in a commercial
          foreclosure strategy based on disadvantaging or delisting mobile handsets that
          contain rival mobile wallets.. The majority of the incentive arguments made in the
          section discussing a foreclosure strategy based on putting commercial pressure on
          OEMs not to install or block the pre-installed embedded SE also apply to a
          commercial foreclosure strategy based on disadvantaging or delisting mobile
          handsets. In particular, the following arguments apply.
          (a)   Foreclosure would only be partial since influencing OS developers or OEMS to
                block mobile wallets would only be effective on the segment of the direct
                channel that is controlled by the Notifying Parties. This would reduce the
                incentive to engage in such a commercial foreclosure strategy (see Recital
                (433);
          (b)   The incentives to foreclose are also reduced due to a strong asymmetry
                between the expected profits of the JV Co (where the gains from foreclosure
                would be realised) and the retail mobile telephony market (where losses from

               foreclosure would occur, due to customers switching to competitors) (see
               Recital (433));
         (c)   As competitive conditions differ between the Transaction markets and the two
               additional markets in which the JV Co would be active (advertising and data
               analytics), these latter markets would not be directly affected by a strategy to
               foreclose the Transaction market. This implies that the profits to foreclose
               would be even smaller compared to the potential losses on the retail mobile
               telephony market, further reducing the incentives to foreclose (see Recital
               (434));
         (d)   Adverse consumer reaction to foreclosure would lead to losses in the retail
               mobile telephony market. This implies that a Notifying Party could gain
               customers by deviating from a joint foreclosure strategy. In comparison to the
               other three commercial foreclosure strategies discussed (see Recital (416)(a),
               (416)(b) and (416)(d)), the Commission would expect an even stronger adverse
               consumer response to the complete delisting of mobile handsets as this
               constitutes a more invasive strategy compared to strategies under which a
               consumer would still be able to purchase the mobile handset even if its
               functionality would be impaired. A related, more subtle form of foreclosure
               would be associated with a reduction of subsidies on mobile handsets that
               contain rival mobile wallets in the direct retail channel controlled by the
               Notifying Parties. Even though this variant of the foreclosure strategy may lead
               to a less pronounced adverse consumer reaction it would still be costly. The
               cost of foreclosure in this case would stem from the fact that popular "must-
               have" mobile handsets with full functionality (including embedded SEs) sold
               by the foreclosing Notifying Parties would become more expensive compared
               to the same mobile handsets sold by competitors. This would induce consumers
               to switch to non-foreclosing operators. (see Recital (437));
         (e)   The adverse consumer reaction also implies that a Notifying Party by deviating
               from the joint agreement could gain more customers as it would stock a wider
               range of mobile handsets or would price them on more attractive terms. In
               order to avoid adverse consumer reaction and potential loss of market shares to
               parties outside of the JV Co each Notifying Party would therefore face
               significant incentives to deviate from a foreclosure strategy (see Recital (438))
               as it would stock a fully functional range of mobile handsets. The Notifying
               Parties would therefore face significant incentives to deviate from a foreclosure
               strategy in order to avoid adverse consumer reaction and potential loss of
               market shares to parties outside of the JV Co (see Recital (438)).
   (473) Regarding a joint foreclosure strategy based on tacit coordination, it seems unlikely
         that the conditions laid down in the Airtours judgment are met. Coordination on a
         joint commercial strategy based on disadvantaging or delisting of mobile handsets
         may not be internally stable since unilateral gains from deviation may exceed the
         expected costs of punishment (see Recital (443)). Secondly, due to the irreversibility
         of deviation, coordination would become less stable as deviation would become
         more attractive and punishment would be less severe (see Recital (444)). Moreover,
         rival mobile wallet providers such as OTTs or integrated OEMs could implement
         counterstrategies which would harm the Notifying Parties while at the same time
         would not impose significant costs on the parties engaging in the counterstrategies.

           These counterstrategies would also likely undermine the external stability of
           coordination (Recitals (445) to (446)). Moreover, the adverse consumer reaction
           would enable competitors to disrupt coordination by capturing sufficiently high
           market shares from the Notifying Parties. The Notifying Parties submit that the
           parties outside the JV Co would need to grow their retail mobile sales by about of
           [5-10]% in order to make foreclosure unprofitable (Recital(448)).
   (474)   In the light of the above analysis, the Commission concludes that it is very unlikely
           that the Notifying Parties would have the ability and the incentive to engage in a joint
           foreclosure strategy based on disadvantaging or delisting of mobile handsets.
   Incentivise independent retailers to market mobile handsets that do not contain rival
   mobile wallets or to set certain default settings which favour their Notifying Parties'
   mobile wallet.
   (475)   The Commission has examined whether the Notifying Parties would have the ability
           and the incentive to induce independent retailers to market mobile handsets that do
           not contain rival mobile wallets or to set certain default settings which favour the
           Notifying Parties' mobile wallet. While the strategies discussed in Recitals (420)(a)-
           (420)(c) are all implemented via the direct retail channel controlled by the Notifying
           Parties, this strategy focuses on the indirect retail channel.
   Views of the Notifying Parties
   (476)   The Notifying Parties argue that they are not in a unique position to incentivise
           independent retailers and that OEMs and OS providers may engage in a similar
           counterstrategy in order to incentivise the sale of mobile handsets that contain rival
           mobile wallets on the open market.
   (477)   As discussed in Recitals and (422) to (423) the Notifying Parties submit that they
           would not have incentives to engage in either unilateral or coordinated foreclosure.
   The Commission's assessment
   (478)   In order to follow a cautious approach as regards a commercial foreclosure strategy
           based on incentivizing independent retailers to market mobile handsets that do not
           contain rival mobile wallets or to set certain default settings which favour the
           Notifying Parties' mobile wallet, the Commission will assess this commercial
           foreclosure strategy in combination with one of the three strategies discussed above
           (see Recitals (420) to (477)) (foreclosure of the direct retail channel controlled by the
           Notifying Parties).
   (479)   Unlike the case of foreclosure strategies targeting the direct retail channel, the
           Notifying Parties would have a more constrained ability to commercially foreclose
           their competitors through incentivizing independent retailers. While the Notifying
           Parties may be in a position to incentivise independent retailers as they already grant
           commissions and […]* subsidies to them (even though these clearly tend not to be
           handset-specific), OEMs and OS providers also grant selective marketing
           subsidies to independent retailers and could engage in a parallel counterstrategy in
           order to incentivise the sale of mobile handsets that contain a rival mobile wallet on
           the open market. In particular, the Commission considers that a potential entrant on
EN                                                109                                                EN

         the mobile wallet market could engage in revenue-sharing agreements with OEMs in
         order to ensure that handsets are equipped with embedded SEs. It is not apparent why
         the Notifying Parties would face a greater incentive than OEMs or OS providers to
         subsidise specific mobile handsets in order to foreclose the mobile wallet market.
   (480) Therefore, while the Notifying Parties would have some commercial ability to
         incentivise independent retailers to market mobile handsets that do not contain rival
         mobile wallets or to set certain default settings which favour the Notifying Parties’
         mobile wallet, the effectiveness of such a strategy could be significantly constrained
         by similar counterstrategies by third parties.
   (481) In the Recitals (482) to (487) below, the Commission considers the incentives (both
         unilateral and coordinated) of the Notifying Parties to engage in a commercial
         foreclosure strategy based on incentivizing independent retailers to market mobile
         handsets that do not contain rival mobile wallets or to set certain default settings
         which favour the Notifying Parties' mobile wallet.
   (482) In order to achieve effective foreclosure of competing offers in the indirect retail
         channel, the Notifying Parties would have to incur significant costs in order to outbid
         OEMs or OS providers to gain support from independent resellers. This would in
         turn considerably raise the cost of foreclosure, again reinforcing unilateral incentives
         to deviate from this commercial foreclosure strategy. It is therefore unlikely that a
         strategy based on foreclosure by incentivizing retailers to market mobile handsets
         that do not contain rival mobile wallets or to set certain default settings which favour
         the Notifying Parties' mobile wallets will lead to the foreclosure of the indirect retail
         channel.
   (483) A less costly strategy would be for the Notifying Parties to provide payments to
         indirect retailers in order to shift only some market share away from rival mobile
         wallet providers. This however would at best lead to partial (and therefore less
         effective) foreclosure of the indirect retail channel.
   (484) Foreclosure incentives are reduced as there is a strong asymmetry between the
         expected profits of the JV CO and the retail mobile telephony market (Recital (433)).
         As there is no strong link between the Transactions markets and the two additional
         markets in which the JV CO would be active (advertising and data analytics), these
         latter markets would not be directly affected by a strategy to foreclose the
         Transactions markets. This implies that the profits to foreclose would be smaller
         compared with the potential losses on the retail mobile telephony market which
         would reduce the incentives to foreclose (see also Recital (434)).
   (485) Regarding a joint foreclosure strategy based on tacit coordination, it seems unlikely
         that the conditions laid down in the Airtours judgment are met. Coordination on a
         joint commercial strategy would be hard to implement given that it depends on
         bilateral negotiations between each Notifying Party and third parties (Recital (442)).
         Coordinated foreclosure may also not be internally stable since unilateral gains of
         deviation may exceed the expected costs of punishment (Recital (443)). Moreover, as
         discussed in Recital (445) to (446), rival mobile wallet providers such as OTTs or
         integrated OEMs could implement counterstrategies which would harm the Notifying
         Parties while at the same time would not impose significant costs on the parties
EN                                              110                                                EN

            engaging in the counterstrategies. These counterstrategies would also likely
            undermine the external stability of coordination (Recital (446)).
   (486)    It should be noted that the Notifying Parties in theory could also apply a foreclosure
            strategy similar to the strategy based on delisting or disadvantageing of mobile
            handsets discussed in Recitals (466) to (474) on the indirect retail channel by
            applying a subsidy that is conditional on selling handsets that only contain the
            Notiyfing Parties' mobile wallet and that would exclude rival mobile wallet
            providers393. The arguments regarding the incentives to foreclose raised in Recital
            (472)(b),(472)(c), (472)(d) and (472)(e), also apply here.
   (487)    In light of the above analysis, the Commission concludes that it is very unlikely that
            the Notifying Parties would have the ability and the incentive to engage in a joint
            foreclosure strategy that would foreclose rival mobile wallets from the independent
            retail channel. Even under the conservative hypothesises that this strategy would be
            used in combination with commercial foreclosure of the direct retail channel
            controlled by the Notifying Parties; the Notifying Parties would not have the ability
            or the incentive to engage in this strategy. The reason is that full foreclosure of the
            indirect retail channel would be too costly given the available counterstrategies that
            could be employed by rival mobile wallet providers. This would leave only a less
            costly strategy based on shifting market shares away from competing mobile wallet
            providers as a feasible option. Such a strategy however would also be ineffective as it
            would only partially foreclose the indirect retail channel.
   Potential foreclosure of non-bank payment solutions
   (488)    A concern was raised during the market investigation with respect to potential
            coordination wider than just among the Notifying Parties, namely between the
            Notifying Parties and banks to coordinate their behaviour with regards to interchange
            fees394. This may raise the incentive to foreclose non-bank payment solutions.
   (489)    However, the Commission considers that the JV Co would not change anything in
            relation to the banks' ability and incentive to disadvantage non-bank payment
            systems as a result of the creation of the JV Co, relative to a scenario in which each
            Shareholder would offer its own mobile wallet, as banks are not shareholders to the
            operation. The Commission therefore considers that the issue of whether the banks
            and the Shareholders could disadvantage non-bank payment solutions would not be
            merger-specific.
   (490)    Also, in order to increase revenue streams, the JV Co would have an incentive not
            only to attract banks but also to work with any payment provider, as each of them
            would provide additional set-up and fixed-fees. Moreover, if consumers and
            merchants value new forms of payment, or a variety of payment options, the JV Co
            would have additional incentives to engage in deals with other payment providers as
   393
          As discussed in Recital (397), the current subsidy business model is based on the subsidization of
          airtime over the contract length and the Notifying Parties do not tie this subsidy to specific mobile
          handset models to any significant extent.
   394
          Three UK's submission from January 2012, page 31. Three UK is concerned that the Notifying Parties
          and payment schemes (Visa, MasterCard) may coordinate their behaviour with regards to interchange
          fees.
EN                                                   111                                                        EN

           this would make the adoption of mobile payments (and the MNOs’ mobile wallets)
           more attractive for consumers and merchants. It is expected that this would enhance
           the business case for the JV Co and it would also lead to additional revenues in the
           form of fees. Moreover, the JV Co would likely want to work with new payment
           providers in order to avoid giving an advantage to rival mobile wallets.
   (491)   In conclusion, the Commission considers that it is very unlikely that the banks and
           the MNOs would have aligned incentives to substantially foreclose non-bank
           payments systems.
   Overall Conclusion
   (492)   The Commission examined in great detail the potential commercial foreclosure
           strategies raised by the market participants that would be most likely based on
           pressuring OEMs not to install or to block the pre-installed embedded SE,
           influencing OS developers or OEMs to block or remove the mobile wallet apps,
           disadvantaging or delisting mobile handsets capable of supporting rival mobile
           wallets, and incentivising independent retailers to market mobile handsets that do not
           contain rival mobile wallets, to set certain default settings which favour their mobile
           wallet or bundling the subsidy given to indirect retailers to a handset that does not
           contain rival mobile wallets. On the basis of the analysis in Section 9.2.1.3, the
           Commission concludes that it is unlikely that the Notifying Parties have the ability or
           the incentive to engage in commercial foreclosure.
   9.2.2.  Bulk SMS services
   (493)   The JV Co would also be active as an aggregator on the market for retail bulk SMS,
           which buys origination and termination services from the MNOs on the market for
           wholesale bulk SMS services in the United Kingdom.
   (494)   The upstream market for wholesale delivery of bulk SMS consists of two main
           elements: the conveyance of the message from the sender (that is to say the JV Co or
           an aggregator) to the mobile network to which the intended recipient has subscribed
           (the home network) and the conveyance by the home network to the recipient's
           mobile handset.
   (495)   Wholesale delivery of bulk SMS can only be provided by MNOs and it is provided
           by all MNOs in the United Kingdom on a competitive basis. Aggregators typically
           contract with one MNO for the delivery of all their bulk SMS messages irrespective
           of the home network of individual recipients of messages. MNOs are able to offer
           this service, which comprises both on-net and off-net delivery (see Recital (506)),
           because of the underlying interconnection arrangements that are in place between
           MNOs for the exchange of SMS messages.
   (496)   Aggregation requires a computer equipped with software for originating messages
           and a connection to one, globally-connected, MNO that is able to route SMS
           messages to any destination through that operator's underlying interconnection
           arrangements with other MNOs. Aggregators who generate sufficient volumes of
           messages to a particular network to justify the investment typically establish their
           own interconnection arrangements with individual networks for the sending of
           messages to (and from) mobile subscribers to that network.

   (500)    The Commission assessed whether the combined position of the Notifying Parties on
            the upstream wholesale market for bulk SMS could lead to a foreclosure of bulk
            SMS aggregators competing with the JV Co on the retail bulk SMS market by
            refusing to terminate bulk SMS that come from competing aggregators on their
            respective networks or by offering higher termination rates to the JV Co's
            competitors.
   9.2.2.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (501)    The Notifying Parties consider that the creation of the JV Co, which will be active on
            the market for retail bulk SMS, would not lead to input foreclosure or discriminatory
            termination rates to the other aggregators.
   (502)    Firstly, it is not envisaged by the Notifying Parties that the JV Co will actively
            promote retail bulk SMS services, but it may be required by customers to provide
            them as an ancillary offering to its overall advertising services, which will focus
            predominantly on various forms of intelligent messaging. […]*. Therefore, the entry
            of the JV Co would not lead to any significant changes in the market structure.
   (503)    Furthermore, the Notifying Parties submit that they will not have the ability to
            engage in a foreclosure strategy against the JV Co's competitors. The Notifying
            Parties explained that if one of them were to attempt to refuse to provide wholesale
            bulk SMS delivery to an aggregator, or to provide it at a price higher than the
            competitive level, then the aggregator could do a deal with another Notifying Party
            or another MNO that would allow it to provide bulk SMS delivery services to all
            mobile subscribers in the United Kingdom, including those of the Notifying Party
            that refused access. This is because each MNO offers wholesale delivery of bulk
            SMS to all mobile subscribers in the United Kingdom, it is easy for the aggregators
            to switch volumes between MNOs and a MNO does not have the ability to block
            bulk SMS traffic arriving from other networks.
   9.2.2.2. The Commission's assessment
   (504)    The Commission assessed the Notifying Parties' arguments concerning their lack of
            ability to substantially foreclose bulk SMS aggregators competing with the JV Co.
   (505)    Each MNO has bilateral reciprocal arrangements with other MNOs for the
            termination of SMS. These interconnection agreements between the MNOs in the
            United Kingdom include a reciprocal rate that both parties charge each other for an
            SMS originating from the other network that they terminate on their own network
            (“termination rate”). This rate applies to all SMSs regardless of the type of message,
            that is to say regardless of whether the SMS originates from an aggregator (bulk
            SMS) or from a consumer (known as “peer to peer” or “P2P”). […]*. For
            example, according to Notifying Parties' data, bulk SMS accounts for […]* [1-5]% of
            the volume of all SMS sent.
EN                                                 114                                             EN

   (506)  An MNO would contract with aggregators for the delivery of bulk SMSs "([…]*)" to
          subscribers not only connected to its own network ("on-net") but also to the
          networks of the other MNOs ("off-net").
   (507)  Aggregators will contract with more than one MNO for delivery in the United
          Kingdom at any time, typically for commercial reasons, and most major aggregators
          will have relations with all the MNOs in the United Kingdom. Once these initial
          connectivity arrangements have been put in place, it would be very easy and
          essentially costless for aggregators to divert volumes between different networks for
          bulk SMS delivery using widely-available least cost routing software. Indeed, most
          of the aggregators who responded to the market investigation, confirmed that they
          use such automated routing models allowing them to identify the cheapest routing for
          bulk SMS services396. One respondent explained that the routing is also based on
          other criteria such as for example direct route, quality, throughput and capabilities397.
          Besides, it appears indeed common for aggregators to quickly switch significant
          volumes from an MNO, making market shares in the United Kingdom's wholesale
          bulk SMS market rather volatile398.
   (508)  Moreover, the existence of grey routes (see Recital (233)) is further constraining the
          Notifying Parties, as they might lose bulk SMS revenues to MNOs outside of the
          United Kingdom.
   (509)  Furthermore, in order to be able to block an incoming bulk SMS, the terminating
          Notifying Party should be first able to identify it as such.
   (510)  The terminating network would have access to a certain amount of information from
          the SMS enabling it to ascertain from which network the SMS was sent. In theory, it
          is possible for a MNO to apply a “filter” to incoming SMSs to identify certain types of
          message, for example a filter such as is used for SPAM messages. However, there are a
          number of reasons, which make it more difficult for MNOs to use these filters, such
          as the ease with which the sending party could change its originating identity and the
          fact that the sending party could “disguise” a bulk SMS as a P2P SMS by using a
          numeric originating number.
   (511)  An MNO would, therefore need to make significant investment in software and
          systems, and analyse vast amounts of data (covering the total SMS traffic arriving on
          its network including P2P) for the sole purpose of blocking bulk SMS that
          aggregators sent via other MNOs399.

         See Notifying Parties' submission of 21 May 2012, p.9, Figure 3. Besides, there is no capacity
         constraint with respect to wholesale delivery of bulk SMS for the MNOs.

   (512)  This was generally confirmed by the responses to the market investigation. For
          example, some respondents, who think that it is technically possible for MNOs to
          trace the originator of bulk SMS and block certain messages terminated on their
          network400 explain that "[t]here are multiple ‘SMS filters’ available for instalment in
          the network. The difficult part is to configure a filter to exclude only truly unwanted
          messages and to keep the configuration up to date"401 or that "MNOs can trace
          messages after the fact but cannot block real time on net messaging. Filters can be
          placed on networks but these are not guaranteed 100%"402.
   (513)  Furthermore, the vast majority of respondents consider that the Notifying Parties
          would continue to supply them with termination of bulk SMS services403.
   (514)  In view of the above, the Commission considers that it is unlikely that the Notifying
          Parties would have the ability to discriminate between the bulk SMSs sent by the JV
          Co and those sent by their competitors that are to be terminated on their networks;
          therefore, the Notifying Parties are unlikely to engage in foreclosure.
   (515)  Furthermore, it would be difficult to reach coordinated foreclosure. In particular, due
          to the lack of transparency in the wholesale market and the rapidly changing market
          shares, there would only be very limited ability for the Notifying Parties to reach an
          agreement on the foreclosure strategy. The lack of transparency stems from the fact
          that contract between MNOs and aggregators appear to be complex, […]*. Deviation
          from a collusive agreement would also be difficult to detect for the other Notifying
          Parties because no MNO is able to determine with certainty the source of all SMSs
          that are terminated on its network; as P2P SMSs are significantly more frequent than
          bulk SMSs, the change in the total number of SMSs terminated on the network as a
          consequence of the loss of the traffic generated by an aggregator would not be
          perceptible to any Notifying Party. This would not change with the creation of the JV
          Co.
   (516)  The Commission also finds that the Notifying Parties would not have an incentive to
          foreclose the JV Co's existing competitors as regards bulk SMSs. The JV Co would
          be a new entrant in a market with well-established players, which generate
          significant incremental revenues for the Notifying Parties (for example as the market
          shares data for retail bulk SMS show, firms other than the Notifying Party account
          for […]* than [ 80-90]% of the retail bulk SMS market). Foreclosure of existing
          competitors in order to reduce competition in the retail bulk SMS market would
          therefore represent a risky strategy, which would undermine the wholesale profits
          earned by the Notifying Party in this market. This consideration applies to both
          unilateral and coordinated incentives to engage in a foreclosure strategy. The fact
          that two of the Notifying Parties are already active in the market for retail bulk SMS
          but only have a modest combined market share appears to confirm the lack of ability
          and incentives to engage in foreclosure of rival bulk SMS providers.

   (517)    In light of the above, the Commission concluded that the operation is unlikely to
            create a significant impediment to effective competition on any of the markets
            related to the JV Co's bulk SMS activities.
   9.3.     Non-horizontal effects – conglomerate effects
   (518)    According to the Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines404, in the assessment of
            conglomerate mergers, the Commission will consider mainly the question of
            foreclosure. The combination of products in related markets may confer on the
            merged entity the ability and incentive to leverage a strong market position from one
            market to another by means of tying or bundling or other exclusionary practices.
   (519)    The Commission analysed how important it would be for a competing M(V)NO to be
            able to offer a mobile wallet in order to remain a credible competitor in the retail
            mobile telephony market.
   (520)    A majority of respondents to the market investigation expect that, at least in the
            short-term, the presence of mobile wallets will not be a key differentiating factor for
            consumers when selecting a mobile handset or airtime contract with a MNO405.
   (521)    Furthermore, even if having the capability to offer a mobile wallet was to become a
            "must-have" factor - a contention that Three UK strongly makes406 - it is likely that
            Three UK would be in a position to offer its own mobile wallet to customers,
            possibly partnering with third parties such as Google or financial institutions.
   (522)    Based on the above, it is concluded that it is most likely that no competition concern
            would arise from conglomerate effects induced by the creation of the JV Co.
   9.4.     Horizontal effects
   9.4.1.   Introduction
   (523)    The Commission has also examined whether the operation will raise horizontal
            competition concerns. The assessment in this section is divided in two parts,
            dedicated respectively to the market for wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform
            services and to the markets for advertising services and data analytics.
   9.4.2.   The framework for the Commission's assessment
   (524)    In making its competitive assessment the Commission applies the following
            principles laid down in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines:
   404
          Non-Horizontal Merger Guidelines, paragraph 91 and onwards.

   406
          Three UK submits that the availability of a mobile wallet will become a key parameter of competition
          when consumers decide on a tariff plan with an operator, as handsets will become increasingly
          multifunctional and the mobile wallet is going to be the next step of an already existing natural
          evolution, becoming a "hygiene factor" in the sense that it will be an integral part of the mobile phone,
          like for example the camera, or access to the internet.

           (a)     A merger may significantly impede effective competition in a market by
                   removing important competitive constraints on one or more sellers, who
                   consequently have increased market power407.
           (b)     The most direct effect of the merger will be the loss of competition between the
                   merging firms. For example, if prior to the merger one of the merging firms
                   had raised its price, it would have lost some sales to the other merging firm.
                   The merger removes this particular constraint. In addition, non-merging firms
                   in the same market can also benefit from the reduction of competitive pressure
                   resulting from the merger, since the merging firm's price increase may switch
                   some demand to the rival firms, which in turn may find it profitable to increase
                   their prices. The reduction in these competitive constraints could lead to
                   significant price increases in the relevant market408.
           (c)     Accordingly, mergers in oligopolistic markets involving the elimination of
                   important competitive constraints that the merging parties previously exerted
                   upon each other together with a reduction of the competitive pressure on the
                   remaining competitors may, even where there is little likelihood of
                   coordination between the members of oligopoly, result in a significant
                   impediment to effective competition409. The Merger Regulation clarifies that
                   all mergers giving rise to such non-coordinated effects must be declared
                   incompatible with the internal market410.
   9.4.3.  Wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform services and secure storage
   (525)   The JV Co will be a new entrant in the nascent market for the wholesale supply of
           mobile wallet platform services. The Notifying Parties are either new entrants in the
           market (for example the Orange/Barclaycard Quicktap product and the Telefónica
           O2 wallet) or they are potential entrants. They are also either new entrants or
           potential entrants on the possible market for secure storage.
   (526)   Some respondents to the market investigation expressed the concern that the
           operation would eliminate competition between the Notifying Parties which would
           otherwise develop separate initiatives. On the other hand, the Notifying Parties
           argued that they would not be able to independently launch separate mobile wallet
           platform services. However, for the assessment of the operation, the Commission
           does not need to conclude whether absent the operation the Notifying Parties would
           be able to independently offer their mCommerce services given that it is unlikely that
           the Notifying Parties can deter significant undertakings from entering the markets for
           the wholesale supply of mobile wallet platform services and secure storage.
   (527)   The Commission has investigated these barriers to entry in this nascent market for
           mobile wallet platform services and secure storage. A number of initiatives have
           already been announced in a number of countries as described in Recitals (73) to
           (76). A number of initiatives have also been launched in the United Kingdom, as set
           out in Recital (70). Potential entrants are banks and financial institutions, other

          MNOs / MVNOs (notably Three UK) and online or OTT players such as Google and
          PayPal. The Commission considers it also likely that Apple would enter if market
          conditions are favourable. Apart from SIM-based SE, access would also be available
          to embedded SEs, and also to SEs included in additional hardware (stickers, tags,
          etc). As described above in the vertical and conglomerate sections, the Notifying
          Parties, will have neither the ability nor the incentive to substantially foreclose
          entrants in this market. This implies that the Notifying Parties would not be able to
          deter entry in downstream market for retail mobile wallets.
   (528)  On this basis, the Commission concludes that the operation will not likely lead to a
          significant impediment to effective competition, as the JV Co would face
          competition from a variety of other market participants. Therefore, even if the
          operation eliminates the potential competition between the Notifying Parties, it is not
          likely to significantly impede effective competition as it will not be able to deter
          significant undertakings (for example Google, Apple) from entering this nascant
          market and competing effectively with the JV Co.
   9.4.4. Data analytics services
   (529)  Currently none of the Notifying Parties is individually active in the provision of data
          analytics services in respect of online and offline advertising and Transactions
          services.
   (530)  The JV Co will be active in the supply of data analytics services in the United
          Kingdom in respect of online and offline advertising and transactions, providing
          reporting analytics, business development analytics and loyalty analytics.
   (531)  The Notifying Parties and other Service Users are going to supply consumer data to
          the JV Co in the United Kingdom. Data analytics involves the analysis of data on
          customers and their behaviours. The JV Co intends to collect and analyse the data
          generated from both its mobile wallet platform services and its advertising
          intermediation services in order to provide its customers with valuable insights into
          consumer behaviour. The Notifying Parties submit that it is not envisaged that the JV
          Co will offer data analytics services as standalone products; rather, they will be
          offered to all customers of the JV Co's Transactions and advertising services. The JV
          Co does not anticipate allocating significant revenues to data analytics services.
   (532)  The JV Co will rely on the following three data sources in particular:
          (a)   basic customer data collected by the MNOs, such as age, residential status,
                profession, location, which will be provided to the JV Co in an anonymised
                form;
          (b)   data collected via the mobile wallet, […]*, however not from online and NFC
                transactions (which take place via third-party payment cards);
          (c)   data collected on the basis of contracts with merchants, for which the JV Co
                might consider entering into agreements with certain merchants to have access
                to data that they generate within their loyalty schemes or through transactions,
                where the customers has provided consent. This data is available to other
                parties also entering into contracts with merchants.
EN                                              119                                               EN

   (533)    This data can be divided into five main categories of customer information that the
            JV Co will be using to enhance its advertising services: […]*.
   (534)    During the market investigation some participants raised the issue that the operation
            might lead to foreclosure of competing providers of targeted advertising services.
            The JV Co is expected to develop a database that would become an essential input
            for targeted mobile advertising and thus create a situation in which other providers of
            mobile advertising (intermediation) services might be dependent on the JV Co or
            might be unable to compete.
   9.4.4.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (535)    The Notifying Parties submit that this service would not be unique and broad
            consumer information could also be sourced from various other major players
            including Google, Apple or Facebook, or card or payment schemes such as Visa or
            MasterCard and their issuing banks, other data analytics providers such as Experian
            and Acxiom, and retailers such as Amazon or eBay. According to the Notifying
            Parties each of these groups will have its own approach to data gathering and
            analytics and their own set of unique customer data, but all would hold sophisticated
            databases that they would analyse in order to provide targeted marketing services to
            advertisers.
   (536)    In addition, the market for data analytics is significant and established, and the JV Co
            will also face competition from a range of existing providers of data analytics.
            Overall, the market for consumer data analytics and market research is worth about
            GBP 2.8 billion per year in the United Kingdom. About 90% of this is made up of
            market research, but according to the Notifying Parties the data analytics element is
            growing rapidly.
   (537)    The Notifying Parties provide that, for example, the most prominent pure play data
            analytics providers Experian and Dunnhumby have a market share of the data
            analytics market in the United Kingdom of respectively [0-5]% and [5-10]%.
            Advertising agencies such as WPP have a market share of less than [0-5]% on the
            same market; big consultancy businesses and technology companies like IBM and
            Accenture have respectively a [5-10]% and less than [0-5]%. Moreover, market
            research companies like TNS Research International has less than [5-10]% and for
            example GfK NOP, Gartner or Nielsen have around [0-5]% market share of the data
            analytics and market research market. This shows how fragmented these markets are.
   9.4.4.2. The Commission's assessment
   (538)    Even if none of the Notifying Parties is individually active in the provision of data
            analytics services in respect of online and offline advertising and Transactions
            services pre-operation, the Commission assessed in detail the issues raised by the
            respondents to the market investigation.
   (539)    In particular the Commission assessed whether the JV Co would foreclose competing
            providers of data analytics or advertising services by combining personal
            information, location data, response data, social behavior data and browsing data
            and by so creating a unique database that would become an essential input for
EN                                               120                                                 EN

             targeted mobile advertising that no competing provider of mobile data analytics
             services or advertising customer would be able to replicate.
   (540)     As regards the various providers of data analytics services, the following diagram
             shows the main elements in the data analytics ecosystem and the overlaps between
             the services offered:
   Figure 3411
   (541)     The JV Co will be providing elements of all three of these circles, thereby occupying
             the overlap area between the three services in the diagram above. However, the JV
             Co will not be providing the software which many of the "Analytics Services"
             companies identified in the diagram provide412, but will be providing some analytics
             of web trends which these companies also provide. Similarly, the JV Co will not be
             selling pure data (as BlueKai or Experian do), but instead will be selling the
             information produced by applying analytics services.
   (542)     The personal data collected by the JV Co will consist for example of age, sex,
             residential status, profession, location, or handset characteristics. In this regard, it has
             to be mentioned that historically, MNOs’ terms and conditions have only allowed the
             MNOs to send their own offers to their customers. Therefore, the Notifying Parties
             will have to build a largely new base of opt-in users for the purpose of data analytics
             and for the JV Co’s advertising activity. The proportion of customers who sign a new
             contract is rather low (approximately [10-20]% per year) and only a subset of these
             customers ticks the box in new contracts that allows the use of their data for
             advertising purposes. Obtaining opt-ins outside the framework of new contracts
             requires a campaign and positive responses (opt-ins) as a result of such campaigns
   411

          are typically low (estimated [10-20]% of the targeted customers)413. In sum, the
          Notifying Parties cannot leverage their existing customer base; they need to start to
          convince customers to opt into JV Co’s targeted advertising services.
   (543)  Information available to the JV Co is however also available to a large extent to both
          existing and new market players such as Google, Apple, Facebook, card issuers,
          reference agencies or retailers414. These players are already using this information to
          provide targeted advertising or are in the process of developing these activities.
          Customers generally tend to give their personal data to many market players, which
          gather and market it. Therefore, this type of data is generally understood to be a
          commodity415.
   (544)  Other ways to reach large numbers of consumers exist, such as utilities providers for
          instance (almost all consumers use utility providers). Additionally, Internet service
          providers also appear to be in a position to reach a very large number of consumers.
          However, it is claimed that MNOs would be "uniquely placed to reach the consumer
          at a certain "right" moment."416. The Commission is of the view that the main
          relevant argument here related to (geo)location of customers.
   (545)  Customers' location data will be collected by JV Co […]*. Apps connected to the OS
          can also have access to all these types of location information. Some of the most
          common examples of players who gather this type of information are Apple417,
          Facebook or Google (with Google Maps). Microsoft considers that it "can provide
          the same level of granularity with respect to the data related to geo-
          location as the Shareholders of the JV. Both Microsoft and the JV would be on equal
          footing as regards the data collected via geo-location."418 Moreover, Deloitte does
          "not expect the JV to provide a unique source of information on the effectiveness of
          geographically-targeted advertising, and therefore anticipate no fundamental
          difference in the development of the analytics services that can be provided to clients
          over the next three years with or without the JV” 419; Deloitte is also of the view that
          "there are a variety of sources of geo-spatial data that are not dependent on the
          mobile operators.”420.
   (546)  The JV Co may also be able to obtain response data from opted-in mobile
          subscribers concerning subscriber's reaction to marketing campaigns. This type of
          data is also available to other mobile wallet providers or payment providers like
          PayPal, payment schemes, card issuers or retailers. In this regard, the Notifying
          Parties confirmed that the JV Co will not have access to data from online or offline

         The absence of foreclosure in the Transaction activities is also helping to ensure that these companies

          transactions using the mobile wallet because these transactions take place via third
          party payment cards. To get access to basket level data, the JV Co would need to
          contract with merchants even if the MNOs developed their own payment cards.
   (547)  Social behavior is also widely available through the consumers' activities on social
          networks (Facebook, LinkedIn etc). Browsing data can be traced by surfing through
          free browsing tools (Google), cookies, Apple iPhone browsing history or the
          Facebook "like" button.
   (548)  Moreover, it is also acknowledged that some other companies, like RIM, would have
          access to a similar amount of data to the JV Co from the mobile handset421.
   (549)  Several respondents to the market investigation confirmed that there will be many
          players such as Experian, BlueKai, Quancast, Google, Omniture and Facebook on
          this competitive market422. The majority of respondents to the market investigation
          consider that, despite the very attractive offering by the JV Co, there will be
          alternatives to which they could switch if the JV Co raises it prices423.
   (550)  In particular, Google is active in data analytics through its Google Analytics service.
          Google Analytics allows marketers and webmasters to track visitors to websites and
          specific URLs. Google Analytics further enables advertisers to review online
          advertising campaigns. Google Analytics includes both free and paid-for services
          (the latter branded Google Analytics Premium). Google Analytics Premium launched
          in the United Kingdom in 2011424. Moreover, Google "does not consider that, as a
          general proposition, mobile or desktop data analytics currently provides a better
          quality insight into consumer behavior than the other. There may be differences in the
          nature of information collected between these categories, but both are able to
          offer a range in terms of the quality of insight into consumer behavior.”425.
   (551)  PayPal was concerned that the JV Co would be able to collect the data and offer
          these services for very competitive conditions, which they themselves will not be
          able to meet426. However, according to another respondent, "customers might be most
          concerned about the value of the data and not specifically the price of the service"427.
   (552)  Another issue raised during the market investigation related to the ownership of the
          data gathered through the mobile wallets. In this regard, the JV Co will only register
          data on transactions carried out by Service User mobile wallets implemented with the
          JV Co. Even then, the data will only be “registered” through the JV Co’s chosen
          […]. The JV Co will not have the ability to register the data on transactions in their
          own right, as these transactions are made using secure protocols set and controlled by
          the payment card issuer and the merchant acquirer, with the mobile wallet merely
          being a container for what is effectively an emulation of a contactless

           payment card428. The JV Co […]* will be dependent on reaching commercial
           agreements with merchants to access data it possesses and has the rights to transfer.
           Moreover, if another mobile wallet is used in the same mobile handset, whether using
           the SIM as SE or an embedded SE, the JV Co will not be able to register data on the
           transactions carried out through the mobile wallet.
   (553)   Yet another issue raised during the market investigation was that, absent the JV Co,
           the Notifying Parties could have entered the (mobile) data analytics market
           individually, hence creating more competition.
   (554)   The Commission also assessed whether absent the operation, the Notifying Parties
           would be able to provide (mobile) data analytics services individually.
   (555)   The vast majority of respondents considered this to be possible429. Some of the
           respondents, who provided a more detailed explanation, consider that the Notifying
           Parties have all the data and technical capability to provide data analytics services430;
           however, they would individually lack the scale and reach of the JV Co431.
           Furthermore, they could have partnered with another data analytics specialist to build
           capability by themselves internally432.
   (556)   Nevertheless, many respondents to the market investigation consider it more efficient
           to have the JV Co as a single point of contact433 and that as data analytics is not a
           core business to them, the investment would not have been justified to provide this
           service alone434.
   (557)   Considering all information available, the Commission concludes that, on all
           possible sub-markets, the JV Co would indeed be able to collect a broad range of
           consumer information, which will be very valuable for its (mobile) data analytics
           services and advertising services. However, many other strong and established
           players are also able to offer comparable solutions to the JV Co. Therefore, other
           providers of advertising services competing with the JV Co would not be foreclosed
           from an essential input and the creation of the JV Co would not have a negative
           effect on competition on the market for (mobile) data analytics, as well as for market
           research services or marketing information services. The question whether the
           Notifying Parties could have entered the market individually absent the operation can
           thus be left open.

   (558)     In light of the above, the operation is not likely to significantly impede effective
             competition on any of the possible markets related to the JV Co's data analytics
             activities.
   9.4.5.    Advertising services
   (559)     The JV Co will act as an advertising intermediary offering a variety of advertising
             services, among others: non-search advertising (on MNOs or MVNOs participating
             in the JV Co and third parties inventories), push SMS, intelligent bulk SMS and pull
             messaging (coupons and vouchers).
   9.4.5.1. The view of the Notifying Parties
   (560)     The Notifying Parties claim that following the creation of the JV Co a new
             competitor will enter the market creating more competition to strong established
             players like Google, Yahoo! or Apple both for static and mobile as well as targeted
             advertising intermediation.
   9.4.5.2. The Commission's assessment
   (561)     The Commission assessed the effects of the creation of the JV Co on the market for
             intermediation of mobile advertising and all possible sub-markets.
   (562)     The market investigation revealed a nuanced position on the effect of the operation
             on the relevant markets for mobile advertising. Many respondents answered that
             depending on the success of the JV Co digital wallet, in terms of opted-in consumers,
             the importance of mobile advertising and data analytics for mobile advertising would
             become apparent435.
   (563)     Many services are still nascent, even if a significant development is expected by
             analysts in the near future 436.
   (564)     None of the Notifying Parties is currently separately engaged in intermediation
             services for any form of digital advertising. Each of them is currently only active in
             the sale of its own inventory to a very limited extent. This is illustrated by Table 5
             below which shows sales by each of the Notifying Parties of its mobile advertising
             inventory to third parties in the UK in 2010:

   (565)     The majority of each Notifying Party's own inventory is at present dedicated to their
             activities as advertisers in their own right: for example, advertising additional
             capabilities on their network, or offering specific loyalty schemes and sponsorship
             arrangements to their own subscribers (for example O2's sponsorship of the England
             rugby team allows it to send promotional offers on tickets to its subscribers). These
             activities are not within the scope of the JV Co, and the Notifying Parties submit that
             they would continue to compete using their own inventory in this way 437.
   (566)     Moreover, as shown in Table 6 below, mobile advertising only represents 2% of the
             total digital advertising438.

   (567)     Under section 8.1.4, the present Decision has left open whether the relevant product
             market should be defined as the intermedation of mobile advertising in general or the
             narrower market for targeted marketing messaging and its possible sub-markets.
   (568)     On an overall market for mobile advertising, the Commission considers that the JV
             Co would face strong global competitors like Google (Doubleclick, AdMob,
             Admeld), Apple (Quattro Wireless/iAd), Yahoo! (Blue Lithium and RightMedia),
             Microsoft (Screentonic, aQuantive), AOL (AOL Advertising), WPP (24/7
             RealMedia), or independent mobile ad networks such as Millenial Media. On such a
             market, the JV Co would operate as an alternative to these established market players
             443
                 .
   (569)     On a narrower market for targeted marketing messaging and in particular, the
             possible sub-markets for intelligent bulk SMS and push SMS, the Commission
             assessed whether the JV Co would become a strong player having access to the
             Notifying Parties end customers and have the ability to send them targeted marketing
             messages.
   (570)     Three UK voiced concerns with respect to targeted marketing messaging. In
             particular, Three UK considered that the JV Co "would act as a central distribution
             channel for advertisers' offers" and "[m]obile subscribers who sign up would receive
             targeted adverts including vouchers, coupons and discounts sent via SMS or MMS or
             enabled over the air by the JV".

   (571)   The market for targeted marketing messaging (and in particular push SMS and
           intelligent bulk SMS) is at present insignificant compared to mobile advertising444.
           The majority of respondents to the market investigation (including market
           participants like Aegis Group, Ericsson, Experian, Google, IBM or mBlox) consider
           that they would be able to send advertisements (including vouchers and coupons) to
           customers in the United Kingdom using mobile wallets targeted to the customer's
           precise location without the cooperation of the MNO445. Google explained that it
           would not require access to the proposed JV Co's advertising platform for these
           purposes446. One advertising agency considers that "the JV would have an advantage
           but only due to the fact that MNOs might have their own messaging platform
           capability across bulk SMS and intelligent bulk SMS services. Each of the individual
           MNOs already run SMS activity and therefore have access to data and platform
           relationships through this activity. A competitor would be able to offer the same
           services but only if it partners with a mobile aggregator and has access to the
           relevant customer data." 447.
   (572)   The Commission, in the present Decision, has analysed possible non-horizontal
           concerns with respect to the bulk SMS markets (see section 9.2.2) and has concluded
           that no significant impediment to effective competition is likely on these markets and
           that bulk SMS aggregators will continue to be able to compete with the JV Co448.
   (573)   Moreover, the JV Co's ability to provide targeted SMS messages would not be
           unique, since there are various players (like Apple or Google)449, who also have the
           mobile numbers of (most of) their customers combined with other customer
           information and could easily create a similar service or provide the required data to
           third parties450. Other market players, like credit card issuers, payment systems,
           retailers, and credit reference companies, possibly in combination, could also create
           offerings or provide data to third parties.
   (574)   Considering the market for pull advertising (including coupons and vouchers), the
           Commission found that loyalty cards can be managed through the mobile wallet app
           accessing the loyalty card issuers’ systems to retrieve the information. Importantly,
           loyalty cards and vouchers do not depend on a SE451. Loyalty cards can be used by
           selecting the relevant card through the wallet and either presenting these at the point
           of sale for key entry, barcode scanning or tapping the phone if a contactless option is

         The likely absence of foreclosure in the Transaction services also reduces to a significant extent the
         possibility for the Notifying Parties and the JV Co to hinder the development of competitors on the
         advertising markets.
   449
         The Notifying Parties highlight that for instance Apple and Google collect mobile numbers when
         customers create their identities on iTunes or Google Play. See the Notifying Parties submission of 23
         May 2012, section 3.2.2.
   450
         The Commission understands from other market participants that Apple or Google do not currently sell
         this type of data directly. (See for example agreed minutes of teleconference call of 15 June 2012 with
         PayPal)
   451
         Only companies that operate loyalty schemes or vouchers with potentially very high values might want
         to protect some data by using the SE. This is not expected to be a frequent scenario. Any access to the
         SE (whether embedded, SIM-based or in the cloud) is likely to have a price implication that is unlikely
         to be justified for straight forward loyalty schemes.

           supported. Vouchers can be accessed through offers apps and offers folders within
           wallets. They are redeemed by presenting a voucher code at the point of sale for key
           entry, barcode scanning or tapping the phone if a contactless option is supported. In
           this latter scenario it is likely that vouchers will be stored on the smartphone but
           outside of the SE. Consumers can request vouchers by tapping their NFC smartphone
           against an NFC tag or smart poster. This uses the NFC capability of the smartphone
           to read the tag or smart poster and receive the voucher or a link to the voucher but
           does not involve the SE 452.
   (575)   In the United Kingdom, there are a number of existing companies providing coupon
           and voucher services to advertisers, such as Groupon, Foursquare, VoucherCloud,
           Gowalla and Google Offers, which will directly compete with the JV Co's offering of
           mobile coupons and vouchers. For example, Groupon is the UK's most visited
           coupon and reward website providing local offers reaching around 15% of the
           internet population453. It is available as an app for iPhones which allows users to
           search for nearby offers using GPS, purchase coupons and redeem them using a
           barcode on their phone454.
   (576)   Considering all information available, the Commission concludes that, on either the
           overall market for mobile advertising or any possible sub-markets, the JV Co would
           indeed face competition from other significant market players.
   (577)   A large part of the participants in the market investigation agreed that the MNOs
           could have entered the market for mobile advertising on a standalone basis455, even
           though many respondents underlined the efficiencies and economies of scale from
           the envisaged cooperation456. A few of them claimed also that the rationale of the
           operation derives from the joint economic exploitation of data analytics and mobile
           advertising. In this respect, a competitor stated that "[i]ntelligence is at the heart of
           the fusions of these two industries"457.
   (578)   However, given that the JV Co would face competition from other significant market
           players on all of the possible relevant markets, the question whether the Notifying
           Parties could have entered the market individually absent the operation can thus be
           left open.
   Conclusion
   (579)   In light of the above, the operation is not likely to significantly impede effective
           competition on any of the possible relevant markets related to the JV Co's activities
           in advertising services.

   (580)  On the basis of those findings, the Commission concludes that the operation is not
          likely to lead to significant impediment to effective competition as a consequence of
          horizontal effects brought about by the operation.
   9.5.   Coordination on the retail mobile telephony market
   (581)  The Commission also analysed in accordance with Article 2(4) of the Merger
          Regulation, whether the JV Co would create scope for coordination among the
          Notifying Parties in the retail mobile telephony market, which is to be appraised in
          accordance with the criteria of Article 101 (1) and (3) of the TFEU. A restriction of
          competition under Article 101(1) TFUE is established when the co-ordination of the
          parent companies' competitive behavior is likely and appreciable and results from
          the creation of the joint venture458.
   (582)  All three Notifying Parties are active and will retain their activities in the retail
          mobile telephony market in the UK, which is a neighbouring market to those of the
          activities of the JV Co.
   (583)  However, the creation of the JV Co is unlikely to affect any of the key parameters of
          competition in the retail mobile telephony market such as the availability of different
          mobile handsets or the number of inclusive minutes, data volume or text messages.
          The Notifying Parties and other Service Users of the JV Co will continue to provide
          mobile voice and data services independently and these services will remain at the
          core of their business. The activities of the JV Co would not be directly addressed to
          consumers at the retail level and none of the proposed activities of the JV Co would
          relate to or impact directly on the provision of mobile voice or data services by each
          of the Notifying Parties to their customers in the retail mobile telephony market in
          the United Kingdom. As such the creation of JV Co will not lead to significant
          changes in the conditions of competition in the retail mobile telephony market in the
          United Kingdom.
   (584)  Also, any information provided by Service Users to JV Co (about their own customer
          bases) will be tightly ring-fenced within JV Co and will not be shared with other
          Service Users.
   (585)  Finally, the activities of JV Co are expected to be relatively small in value terms
          compared to the Notifying Parties' respective activities in the retail mobile telephony
          market. As explained in Recital (433) gross profits for the retail mobile telephony
          activities of the Notifying Parties are roughly about […] times higher than the
          expected profits of the JV Co after its initial ramping-up period.
   (586)  Therefore, the Commission concludes that there should be no practical scope for
          coordination of the Notifying Parties in the retail mobile telephony market through
          the JV Co.

   10.    EFFICENCIES
   (587)  The overall impact of the operation will also be affected by the likely efficiencies
          that are brought about by the operation. While there is a lack of anti-competitive
          effects irrespective of efficiencies, these efficiencies form a part of the overall
          competitive assessment.
   (588)  The Notifying Parties submit that the operation will offer a range of new and
          innovative Transactions services, advertising services and data analytics services
          which are either not currently offered or are only offered to a limited extent by the
          Notifying Parties.
   (589)  In particular, the Notifying Parties explain that the operation will allow the individual
          MNOs to overcome the difficulties they face when acting independently, increasing
          their ability to act as credible competitors to the OTT operators. The Notifying
          Parties argue that the JV Co will be of a sufficient scale to develop a mobile wallet
          platform and services that will attract financial and other service providers to
          participate, driving consumer demand and take-up of mobile wallets. Furthermore,
          the Notifying Parties claim that the JV Co will increase the pool of opted-in
          customers which an advertiser can access, increasing the ability to target advertising
          to the most responsive customer groups and reducing the cost to advertisers of
          developing expertise in mobile messaging. Finally, the Notifying Parties state that
          the JV Co will promote the development of technology to facilitate mobile wallet
          portability ensuring that consumers will be able to move their mobile wallets when
          they choose to switch mobile handsets or MNO thereby minimising the costs of
          switching.
   (590)  The market investigation provided indications that potential benefits could arise from
          the operation. For instance, market participants noted that "[t]he JV provides a useful
          single POC for companies looking for mobile data analytics services"459 and "[t]o
          get a scale number of users in the UK market in order to encourage the market to
          take off and develop. A critical mass of users will in turn provide the necessary
          incentive to UK businesses to invest in NFC terminals, mobile payments, etc"460.
          Also, market participants believed that the rationale of the JV Co is linked to
          "[e]conomies of scale, shared infrastructure costs, standardisation"461.
   (591)  Efficiencies, in order to be acceptable as a countervailing factor under the Merger
          Regulation must be verifiable, likely to be passed on to consumers and be merger
          specific to the extent that no other practicable less-anticompetitive alternatives exist
          to achieve the same benefits462.
   (592)  The Notifying Parties have not provided a detailed analysis showing that any such
          efficiencies meet the criteria of the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, and in particular
          that they could not be achieved through less anticompetitive alternatives.

   (593) However, it is not necessary to precisely estimate the magnitude of these likely
         efficiencies given the operation's lack of anti-competitive effect irrespective of
         efficiencies.
   11.   GENERAL     CONCLUSION OF THE COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT IN THE RELEVANT
         MARKETS
   (594) MCommerce is nascent with a number of interested parties entering the sector and a
         number of different technologies emerging. The JV Co will not likely have the
         technical or commercial ability, nor the incentive, to substantially foreclose entry, or
         hinder expansion by competitors in relation to wholesale or retail mobile wallet
         platform services, advertising services or data analytics.
   (595) A sufficient number of competitors are already emerging or are very likely to emerge
         in the near future. Some of these competitors are companies with significant market
         power, customer base and expertise in their field. They include financial service
         providers, internet and OTT players, players already active in online payments and
         other M(V)NOs. The Commission does not consider that the operation may
         significantly raise barriers to entry, for example by making it more difficult for
         potential entrants to obtain the necessary inputs. Therefore, the Commission
         concludes that even if the Notifying Parties do not emerge individually as actual
         competitors because of the JV Co, a sufficient number of other competitors will
         remain to ensure adequate competitive pressure post-operation. Similarly, the
         Commission concludes that the JV Co will not likely be able to stifle innovation;
         indeed, the mCommerce market will likely continue to be characterised by the
         development of new initiatives and the emergence of a variety of possible
         commercial and technical evolutions in the coming years.
   (596) The Commission concludes that the operation will not likely lead to a significant
         impediment to effective competition within the meaning of Article 2(2) of the
         Merger Regulation in any of the relevant markets or potential sub-markets identified
         in Section 8.
   (597) The operation should therefore be declared compatible with the internal market and
         the functioning of the European Economic Area Agreement pursuant to Article 8(1)
         of the Merger Regulation and Article 57 of the EEA Agreement.
