Dear Sirs,
Subject: Case No COMP. 1816 - Churchill Insurance Group/NIG Holdings
             Notification of 21.12.1999 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
             No 4064/89
1. On 21 December 1999, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
     concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/891 by
     which Churchill Insurance Group Ltd ("Churchill") takes sole control of National
     Insurance and Guarantee Corporation ("NIG") by way of purchase of shares.
2. After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
     operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 and does
     not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and with the
     functioning of the EEA Agreement.
I.     THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
3. Churchill is a subsidiary of Winterthur UK holdings Limited, which is the UK
     holding company for the Winterthur Group, a global insurance group, headquartered
     in Switzerland and operating in 30 countries around the world. The Winterthur Group
     is part of the Swiss based global financial services group Credit Suisse Group (CS
     Group). NIG is an insurance company which conducts general insurance business and
     is also the holding company for all the Skandia group’s non-life subsidiaries in the
     United Kingdom. NIG writes motor and household insurance and a variety of
     specialist commercial lines.

4. Under a sale and purchase agreement signed 10 December 1999 Churchill will
    acquire 100% of NIG’s shares.
II. CONCENTRATION
5. The transaction constitutes an acquisition of sole control by Churchill of NIG within
    the meaning of Article 3 of the Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6. The combined aggregate world-wide turnover of the undertakings concerned
    exceeded 5,000 million EURO in the last financial year (CS Group 28,276 million
    EURO; NIG: 503 million EURO). Each of them has a Community-wide turnover in
    excess of ECU 250 million (CS Group, EURO 10,458 million; and NIG, EURO 273
    million), but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate Community-
    wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified operation
    therefore has a Community dimension. It does not constitute a co-operation case
    under the EEA Agreement, pursuant to Article 57 of that Agreement.
IV. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
     A. Relevant product markets
7. Following the practice of the Commission assessing cases in the insurance sector 2,
    there are three major market segments: general insurance, life insurance and
    reinsurance. The market in which the parties to the concentration operate is the
    general insurance market, in particular personal lines business (particularly motor and
    household). NIG also has some small commercial lines business (ie generally small
    rather than large commercial business).
8. However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
    product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
    does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
    competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that
    area.
     B. Relevant geographic markets
9. The notifying party states that the relevant geographic market is the United Kingdom.
    However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
    product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
    does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
    competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that
    area.
    C. Competitive assessment
10. The parties estimate that the new entity will write a total of 1.4 million private motor
     policies On the basis of a national market for private motor insurance, that would
2 M.1719-Delta Lloyd Verzekeringsgroep/Nuts Ohra, M.1499-Swiss Life/Lloyd Continental, M.1498-
  Aegon/TransAmerica, M.1453-AXA/GRE and M.1777-CGU/Hibernian.
                                                 2

    give them a market share of 7.1% and number five in the segment’s ranking. On
    household insurance, where the market leader in the UK is Royal & Sun Alliance,
    the new entity will reach a market share between 5% and 6% (on the basis once
    again of a national market for this type of insurance). NIG also writes small
    commercial risks with market shares around 1%. The CS Group does not write these
    commercial risks in the UK.
11. NIG is active in extended warranty insurance related to vehicles and white and
    brown domestic goods sector. NIG (gross written premiums Euro 233.5 millions in
    this segment) has a 60% market share. However, no member of the CS Group writes
    this type of insurance and none of the parties are engaged in business activities in the
    United Kingdom which are either upstream or downstream of the extended warranty
    market.
12. Consequently, the proposed concentration does not create or strengthen a dominant
    position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in
    the EEA or any substantial part of that area.
V.     ANCILLARY RESTRAINTS
13. Under Clause 9 of the Agreement and for a period of three years, no member of the
    Skandia Group, under certain limitations: a) will compete with the type of insurance
    business carried out by any member of the NIG group in the United Kingdom, b)
    will solicit the service of employees who occupy senior or managerial positions of
    the acquired group. These obligations are intended to guarantee the acquirer the full
    value of the assets transferred and the confidential know-how of NIG’s business
    following its acquisition. The geographic scope of these restrictions is limited to the
    United Kingdom. The Commission considers the clause directly related and
    necessary to the implementation of the concentration.
VI. CONCLUSION
14. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
     operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
     Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
     Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
