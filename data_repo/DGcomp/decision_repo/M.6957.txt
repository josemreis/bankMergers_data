 To the notifying party:
 Dear Sir/Madam,
 Subject:      Case No COMP/M.6957 - IF P&C/ TOPDANMARK
               Commission decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation
               No 139/20041
 (1)       On 19 August 2013, the European Commission received the notification of a
           concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004. The
           notification concerns the acquisition by the undertaking IF P&C Insurance Holding
           Ltd ("IF P&C"), hereinafter the Notifying Party, of de facto sole control within the
           meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation over Topdanmark A/S
           ("TopDK"), following an increase of its voting rights ("the Transaction"). IF P&C
           and TopDK are collectively referred to as the "Parties".2
 1.        THE PARTIES
 (2)       IF P&C is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sampo plc, listed on the NASDAQ OMX
           Helsinki. IF P&C provides insurance products and services in the field of property
           and casualty insurance (non-life insurance) in Sweden, Norway, Finland and
           Denmark, as well as in the Baltic countries and Russia. IF P&C has limited
           activities within the life insurance field. Sampo plc also controls Mandatum Life
           Group, a company active in the life insurance market in Finland and the Baltic
           countries which holds 21.2% of the shares in Nordea Bank AB.
 1       OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ("the Merger Regulation"). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on
         the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') has introduced certain changes, such as the
         replacement of 'Community' by 'Union' and 'common market' by 'internal market'. The terminology of
         the TFEU will be used throughout this decision.

(3)   TopDK is a public limited company listed on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen, the
      parent of the Topdanmark Group and does not itself perform any independent
      activities. The Topdanmark Group provides insurance products and services within
      both non-life and life insurance exclusively in Denmark.
2.    THE OPERATION
(4)   IF P&C has since 2008 held a minority shareholding in TopDK, partly through its
      Finnish subsidiary IF P&C Insurance Company Ltd.3 As explained by the
      Notifying Party, on 16 May 2011 IF P&C increased its shareholding in TopDK
      from 14.74 % to 21.24% (including treasury shares), which resulted in an increase
      of its voting rights from 16.44 % to 22.75% (as per TopDK's Annual General
      Meeting ("GM") of 12 April 2011).
(5)   Even if the absolute number of shares held by IF P&C has not increased since then,
      TopDK has accelerated, over the course of 2011-2013, an on-going Share Buyback
      Programme it launched in 1998. Due to this programme and the ensuing
      cancellation of shares, IF P&C's shareholding and voting rights gradually increased
      over time. As per 18 June 2013, IF P&C's shareholding in TopDK increased to
      25.18% (including treasury shares) and its voting rights to 26.51%.
(6)   In terms of the Consolidated Jurisdiction Notice, paragraph 59, "[a] minority
      shareholder may also be deemed to have sole control on a de facto basis. This is in
      particular the case where the shareholder is highly likely to achieve a majority at
      the shareholders' meetings, given the level of its shareholding and the evidence
      resulting from the presence of shareholders in the shareholders' meetings in
      previous years. Based on the past voting pattern, the Commission will carry out a
      prospective analysis and take into account foreseeable changes of the
      shareholders' presence which might arise in future following the operation. The
      Commission will further analyse the position of other shareholders and assess their
      role."4
(7)   The Commission's analysis on the basis of IF P&C's shareholding, the historic
      voting pattern at shareholders' meetings and the position of other shareholders
      indicated that IF P&C is likely to have a stable majority of the votes at the
      shareholders' meeting.
(8)   As to past voting patterns, the Commission's analysis revealed that IF P&C already
      achieved a simple majority of the votes present at three recent GMs (namely, the
      Extraordinary GM of November 2010, the Annual GM of 19 April 2012 and the
      Annual GM of 17 April 2013).
(9)   The Commission's prospective analysis revealed that a shareholder with 26.51% of
      the voting rights would have achieved a simple majority at each of the seven most
      recent GMs.5 The conclusion would be the same if one of the methods proposed by
3   On 18 June 2013, all shares held by IF P&C Finland were transferred internally to IF P&C.
4   Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 on the control of
    concentrations between undertakings, OJ C 95, 16.4.2008, page 1.
5   This prospective analysis was carried out on the basis of the methodology applied in Case No
    COMP/M.4994 – Electrabel/Compagnie Nationale du Rhone, para 45. The conclusion of the
    prospective analysis would not differ, even if one were to consider the proportion of voting rights
    required to achieve simple majority at the 2008-2013 GMs. Again, also based on this method a
                                                    2

       IF <U+03A1> & C, consisting in adjustments for the effect of the variance in its
       shareholdings on the number of voting shares attending each GM, is applied.
(10)   Moreover, TopDK's shareholder structure is quite dispersed with only IF P&C
       holding more than 5% of the shares. IF P&C is also the only industrial shareholder
       among TopDK's top 20 shareholders. Also, based on the evidence in the file, there
       are no indications of a possible community of interest - or other incentives - among
       the remaining shareholders for them to align their position so as to countervail IF
       P&C's voting rights.
(11)   Given that a simple majority at GMs allows IF P&C to adopt alone a number of
       important decisions, such as the appointment of the members of the Board of
       Directors, and indirectly to influence, namely by having the possibility to veto,
       other strategic decisions, such as budget, finances, business policies and the
       appointment of the Executive Board, the Commission concludes that IF P&C
       passively acquired de facto sole control over TopDK.
(12)   The operation thus constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article
       3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
3.     EU DIMENSION
(13)   The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of
       more than EUR 5 000 million6 (for IF P&C (Sampo Group): EUR 5 681 million,
       for TopDK: EUR 1 614 million). Each of them has an EU-wide turnover in excess
       of EUR 250 million (for IF P&C (Sampo Group): […] million, for TopDK: EUR
       […] million) but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate EU-
       wide turnover within one and the same Member State.
(14)   The notified operation therefore has an EU dimension, within the meaning of
       Article 1(2) of the Merger Regulation.
4.     MARKET DEFINITION
4.1.   Product market definition
(15)   In previous decisions relating to the insurance sector, the Commission has
       distinguished three broad categories of insurance products: life insurance, non-life
       insurance and reinsurance.7 It has also made a distinction between, on the one
       hand, a product market for insurance provision (which is segmented into three
       markets as described above) and, on the other hand, a product market for insurance
       distribution.8
     shareholder with 26.51% of the voting rights, just like IF P&C, would have achieved simple majority
     at all those seven GMs. For example, the 2012 Annual GM featured an attendance rate of 42.47%
     (excluding treasury shares). This means that a shareholder with slightly more than half of this
     proportion (i.e. slightly more than 21.24%) would have been capable of obtaining a majority.

                                                      3

4.1.1.  Non-life insurance
(16)    In previous decisions,9 the Commission noted that, from a demand-side
        perspective, non-life insurance may at least in theory be divided into as many
        individual product markets as there are different kinds of risks covered, given that
        characteristics, premiums and purposes are distinct and that there is no
        substitutability from the consumer’s perspective between different risks insured.
(17)    However, the Commission has also recognised that from a supply-side perspective
        the conditions for insurance of different types of risk are quite similar and most
        large insurance companies are active in several types of risk. This suggests that
        different types of non-life insurance could be included in the same product
        market.10
(18)    The Commission has in the past generally considered a distinction between the
        following segments: (i) accident and sickness; (ii) motor vehicle; (iii) property; (iv)
        marine, aviation and transport ("MAT"); (v) liability; (vi) credit and suretyship; and
        (vii) travel.11
(19)    The Notifying Party agrees with the Commission's previous finding regarding the
        product market definition, and mentions that no narrower segmentation should be
        made.
(20)    In the case at hand the market investigation largely supported a segmentation of the
        market for the provision of non-life insurance products based on the type of risk
        covered.12
(21)    In any event, the exact product market definition for the provision of non-life
        insurance can be left open, as the Transaction does not raise any serious doubts as
        to its compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market definition.
4.1.2.  Insurance distribution
(22)    In its administrative practice,13 the Commission in the past concluded that a
        downstream market for insurance distribution involves the procurement of
        insurance cover for individual and corporate customers through different
        distribution channels, whether comprised of direct writers, tied agents or
        intermediaries such as banks and brokers.

(23)     The Commission has left open the question as to whether the market for insurance
         distribution comprises exclusively all outward (i.e. non-owned and third-party)
         insurance distribution channels (e.g. brokers and agents), or if the sales forces and
         office networks of insurance undertakings (constituting a direct means of sale to
         end-customers) should also fall within the market for insurance distribution.14
(24)     In addition, the Commission has also considered that a distinction could be made
         between the distribution of non-life and life insurance products due to differences
         in the applicable regulatory regime and the fact that different providers are
         involved in the distribution of life and non-life insurance products.15
(25)     The Notifying Party submits that the product market for insurance distribution
         should only comprise outward distribution channels and that it should not be
         further subdivided between distribution of life and non-life insurance.
(26)     The market investigation has been to some extent inconclusive. From a supply-side
         perspective, the majority of insurance providers consider life and non-life insurance
         products as being distributed through different distribution channels.16 In
         particular, direct distribution is a common way to sell non-life insurance policies in
         Denmark, whereas life insurance products are distributed via intermediaries such as
         employers or banks.
(27)     From a demand-side perspective, the majority of customers explained that the
         distributors from which they purchase non-life insurance products also offer life
         insurance, even though they largely acknowledge the existence of material
         differences in the distribution of these two types of products.17
(28)     However, the market investigation largely confirmed that direct means of sale to
         end customers should be included in the market for the distribution of insurance
         products along with all other outward distribution channels such as agents, brokers
         and other intermediaries, such as banks.18
(29)     In any event, the exact product market definition for insurance distribution can be
         left open in this case, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its
         compatibility with the internal market under any plausible market definition.
4.2.     Geographic market definition
4.2.1.   Non-life insurance
(30)     With regard to the geographic scope of the market for the provision of non-life
         insurance and its various sub-segments, the Commission has generally considered
         these markets as national, with the exception of (i) large commercial risks, such as
         the insurance of aerospace risks, which is most likely to be at least EEA-wide in
14     COMP/M.6649 Allianz/Insurance portfolio and Brokerage services of Gan Eurocourtage, para.15;

        scope and, (ii) the MAT insurance market, which is likely to be wider than national
        for large/multinational corporate customers and large risk insurance respectively.19
        However, the Commission ultimately left the exact scope of the geographic market
        open.
(31)    The Notifying Party agrees with the Commission's past findings with respect to the
        geographic scope of the market for the provision of non-life insurance and its
        various sub-segments.
(32)    The market investigation revealed that providers of non-life insurance products
        unanimously believe that competition takes place at national level,20 even if they
        acknowledge that, at least in principle, there would be no specific factors
        preventing insurance companies located in other EU countries from selling
        insurance products to customers in Denmark.
(33)    However, customers’ views were less conclusive. Certain customers organise EEA-
        wide tenders to select their insurance provider, where insurance companies active
        internationally compete with Danish insurance companies. Some other customers
        stress that their risk profile requires an insurance capacity which only a provider
        with international presence would be able to offer.21 Finally, a portion of
        customers suggests that the market for non-life insurance should be at least EEA
        wide due to the fact that certain business activities require coverage exceeding
        national borders, such as marine insurance for example.22
(34)    In any event, the exact geographic market definition for the provision of non-life
        insurance can be left open in this case, as the Transaction does not raise serious
        doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market under any market definition.
4.2.2.  Insurance distribution
(35)    In previous decisions,23 the Commission, while recognising the national nature of
        insurance distribution channels, left the exact definition open, in particular with
        respect to the question as to whether the relevant geographic market is wider than
        national.
(36)    The Notifying Party agrees that the geographic scope of the market for insurance
        distribution is at least national.
(37)    In any event, the exact geographic market definition for insurance distribution can be
        left open in this case, as the Transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its
        compatibility with the internal market under any market definition.

5.    COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
(38)  The Transaction gives rise to horizontal overlaps in the markets for the provision
      and for the distribution of non-life insurance products. The Transaction also gives
      rise to vertical relationships between the parties' activities in the markets for
      provision of certain types of insurance products and the distribution of such
      products. Lastly, the transaction creates limited horizontal overlaps as well as
      vertical links in the market for insurance distribution.
5.1.  Non-life insurance
(39)  As regards the provision of non-life insurance, the Parties' combined market share is
      above [10-20] % in the following segments in Denmark: (i) accident and sickness
      insurance ([10-20]% with an increment of [0-5]%), (ii) motor vehicle insurance ([20-
      30]% with an increment of [5-10]%), (iii) property insurance ([20-30]% with an
      increment of [5-10]%), (iv) MAT insurance ([20-30]% with an increment of [5-
      10]%) and (v) liability insurance ([30-40]% with an increment of [10-20]%). The
      merged entity will be the market leader in the sub-segments for the provision of motor
      vehicle and property insurance.
(40)  However post-transaction, the merged entity will continue to face competition from
      various market players. In particular, the merged entity will continue to face Tryg, the
      second biggest market player in Denmark ([20-30]% in the overall non-life insurance
      market, [20-30]% in motor vehicle insurance and [20-30]% in property insurance),
      Codan, which is the third biggest player ([10-20]% in the overall non-life insurance
      market, [10-20]% motor vehicle insurance and [10-20]% in property insurance) and
      various other players, whose market shares are not insignificant.
(41)  The market investigation indicated that generally IF P&C and TopDK are not close
      competitors.24 Customers perceive IF P&C as competing primarily against
      international insurance companies, whereas TopDK competes primarily locally in
      Denmark.25 A limited number of competitors are inclined to consider IF P&C and
      TopDK as close competitors in the sub-segments for accidents and sickness and
      motor vehicle insurance, due to similarities in their customers' portfolios and to the
      fact that their products are seen as close substitutes.26
(42)  The market investigation confirmed the Notifying Party's submission that customers
      would face no difficulties to switch to other insurance providers in the event of a price
      increase post-merger. Indeed, the market investigation indicated that customers
      have the ability to select an alternative insurance provider and that switching is
      relatively easy in all segments of the overall non-life insurance market.27
(43)  Regarding MAT insurance in Denmark, the Transaction eliminates a player holding a
      [5-10]% market share, with the merged entity having a combined market share of
      [20-30]% in a market where three strong players would remain post-market and

      where other players have minimal market shares.28 Post-transaction Codan will
      remain the market leader with a large market share of around [50-60]%. The
      Notifying Party submits that the merged entity would therefore be able to increase its
      competitive pressure on Codan. Moreover, the Notifying Party explains that this sub-
      segment is subject to significant international pressure, as most MAT customers are
      large commercial customers with sufficient means and knowledge to place risks
      outside Denmark.
(44)  The market investigation largely confirmed the Notifying Party’s arguments. As
      regards MAT insurance, the vast majority of customers select their insurance
      provider via a tender process which is frequently organised at EEA level.29 In
      addition, both customers and competitors largely confirmed that international
      players exercise strong competitive pressure on providers of MAT insurance in
      Denmark.30 They emphasised - almost unanimously - that post-transaction they
      will continue enjoying a large choice of MAT insurance providers.31 In addition,
      the market investigation revealed that customers generally do not face particular
      difficulties to change the insurance provider in the segment.32 Therefore even if a
      market wider than national is to be considered, the transaction will not raise serious
      doubts regarding its compatibility with the internal market.
(45)  Regarding the segment for liability insurance in Denmark the merged entity will be
      the second biggest market player ([30-40]% combined market share) after Tryg
      ([30-40]%) and will continue to face competition from Codan ([10-20]%) and HDI-
      Gerling ([5-10]%) as well as from several other smaller competitors active in
      Denmark. The market investigation largely confirmed that there are no obstacles
      preventing customers from switching the insurance provider on this market
      segment.33
(46)  In light of the above, the Commission concludes that the Transaction does not give
      rise to serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market as regards the
      various possible relevant markets for non-life insurance.
5.2.  Insurance distribution
(47)  The market investigation revealed that the vertically integrated insurance companies
      have to be considered as part of the market for insurance distribution in Denmark. In
      this context, the merged entity's market share on an overall Danish market for
      insurance distribution, which includes the distribution of both life and non-life
      insurance products is [5-10]%, while its market share in the market for the
      distribution of life insurance only is [0-5]%. However, in a hypothetical market for
      the distribution of non-life insurance only (including direct means of sale), the merged
28   Besides the Parties, Tryg and Codan, the remaining market players have a combined market share of
     below 2%.

       entity would have a market share of [10-20]% (with an increment of [0-5]%) and the
       Transaction would therefore give rise to an affected market.
(48)   The merged entity's main competitors in the market for the distribution of non-life
       insurance are Tryg (with a market share of [10-20]%) and Codan (with a market share
       of [10-20]%). In addition, this market features a significant number of third party
       distributors, including bancassurance, trade unions, car dealerships and others, with an
       aggregated market share of around [10-20]%. Given the moderate market share of the
       merged entity, the small increment brought about by the Transaction and the large
       number of competitors active in this market, it is highly unlikely that the Transaction
       will lead to any significant impediment of competition.
(49)   In the light of the above and as far as the possible Danish market for distribution of
       non-life insurance is concerned, the Commission concludes that the Transaction
       does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market.
5.3.   Vertical relationships
(50)   Only if individual types of risks were to be seen as constituting separate relevant
       product markets, the Transaction would result in vertically affected markets. In
       particular, the merged entity’s market share would exceed [20-30]% on the following
       sub-segments: motor vehicle ([20-30]%) and liability insurance ([30-40]%). This
       would create a vertical relationship between these two sub-segments and the market
       for the distribution of non-life insurance.
(51)   The Notifying Party submits that neither IF P&C nor TopDK sell/distribute insurance
       products other than their own. The same applies to each company's respective tied
       agents and in general to the Danish insurance market.34 Internal distribution remains
       the main route for sales of insurance products in Denmark and makes up
       approximately 85% of the Danish market for the distribution of non-life insurance.
(52)   The market investigation largely confirmed the Notifying Party’s arguments. Indeed,
       Danish insurance providers do not generally distribute the products of their
       competitors. 35 For this reason, already pre-transaction the Parties neither offered their
       products to competitors for distribution, nor constituted important distribution outlets
       for those competitors. In addition, given the absence of a significant degree of market
       power in the upstream markets of provision of motor vehicle ([20-30]%) and liability
       insurance ([30-40]%), input foreclosure of other downstream distributors of such
       insurance products as a result of the transaction does not appear likely. Conversely,
       considering the fact that the combined market shares of the Parties on the possible
       downstream market for distribution of non-life insurance products in Denmark is [10-
       20]% and considering the largely internal distribution method of such insurance
       products, customer foreclosure effects on upstream providers of non-life insurance
       products is equally unlikely. In light of this, even if this vertical relationship between
       the provision and the distribution of non-life insurance in Denmark constitutes an
34   IF P&C has a distribution agreement with Sygeforsikringen "Danmark" which markets and distributes
     IF P&C's accident insurance to its members ([…]). In addition, IF P&C has distribution agreements
     for commercial healthcare insurance products with three undertakings ([…]).
35   There are, however, some arrangements between non-life insurance companies and life insurance
     companies to provide together a complete insurance package for customers. Replies to questions 24 -

      affected market, it is highly unlikely that the concentration will have any impact on
      competition in the market.36
(53)  In view of the foregoing, the Commission concludes that the Transaction would not
      raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market as regards these
      hypothetical vertical links between the provision and the distribution of insurance
      products.
6.    CONCLUSION
(54)  For the above reasons, the European Commission has decided not to oppose the
      notified operation and to declare it compatible with the internal market and with the
      EEA Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the
      Merger Regulation.
