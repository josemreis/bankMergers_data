 Dear Sirs,
 Re: Case No. IV/M207 - EUREKO
         Your notification pursuant to Article                                                     4    of       Council
         Regulation No. 4064/89 (Merger Regulation)
 1.      On 20 March 1992, the undertakings Coöperatie Avéro/Centraal
 Beheer Groep U.A. (AVCB), Friends' Provident Life Office,
 Topdanmark A/S and WASA Insurance Group (WASA Sakförsäkring and
 WASA Livförsäkring) notified their agreement to set up a joint
 venture, EUREKO B.V., to which they will transfer their non-life
 and life insurance business outside their respective home
 countries.
 2.      After full examination of the notification, the Commission
 has come to the conclusion that the notified operation does not
 fall within the scope of the Merger Regulation.
 I.      THE PARTIES AND THE AGREEMENT
 3.      The four parties are insurance companies or groups engaged
 in direct non-life and life insurance, except for Friends'
 Provident which is only active in the life insurance sector. Each
 operates primarily in its own country: AVCB in The Netherlands,
 Friends' Provident in the UK, Topdanmark in Denmark and WASA
 Insurance Group in Sweden.
 4.      The agreement, signed on 18 March, will create a holding
 company, EUREKO B.V., to which they will contribute all their
 direct life and non-life insurance operations outside their own
 countries. This involves the transfer of a number of subsidiaries
 or minority shareholdings in the following countries: Portugal,
 Belgium, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, United States, Canada,
 Australia and Barbados.

                               - 2 -
II. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
5.   The proposed operation has a Community dimension. Calculated
in accordance with Article 5(3) of the Merger Regulation, the
aggregate worldwide turnover of the undertakings concerned in 1991
amounted to [...]* million ECU for AVCB, [...]* million ECU for
Friends' Provident, [...]* million ECU for Topdanmark and [...]*
million ECU for WASA Insurance Group. AVCB, Friends' Provident and
Topdanmark achieved an aggregate Community-wide turnover of more
than 250 million ECU, of which they did not achieve more than two-
thirds in one and the same Member State.
III. JOINT VENTURE
Joint control
6.   In principle, each of the parent companies will hold a 25%
share in EUREKO. This is the situation at present following
signature of the Formation Agreement and the Shareholders'
Agreement. However, the precise shareholdings of the parties may
fluctuate over time, depending on a number of factors, including
the relative value of the international business that each of the
parties will transfer to EUREKO. However, with the aim of ensuring
that each shareholder has approximately equal voting and economic
rights in EUREKO, the parties have agreed that none of them will
hold more than 30% of the voting rights and that a shareholder
with less than 20% in EUREKO will have the possibility to increase
its stake with cash or shares up to 25%.
7.   The initial shareholders in EUREKO are AVCB, Friends'
Provident, Topdanmark and WASA Insurance Group, but further
shareholders will be sought, on the basis of one new participant
per geographic area. If new shareholders join, the shareholding
structure will be adapted in such a way that they will acquire an
equivalent stake to that of the parties and the same degree of
influence in EUREKO's management as the parties have at present.
8.   EUREKO will hold a stake of at least 10% in each of its
parent companies' share capital and will also nominate two
representatives to the supervisory board to each of them. The
shareholding taken by EUREKO in Topdanmark may be of the order of
30% but EUREKO will nevertheless not be entitled to have more than
two directors in Topdanmark.
9.   EUREKO will be set up with a Management Board, whose members
will be appointed by simple majority in the general shareholders'
meeting. Its activity will be subject to the control of the
Supervisory Board, to which each of the parent companies is
entitled to nominate two directors.
10. The Supervisory Board is entitled to approve a number of
decisions of the Management Board by simple majority or a super
majority (more than two-thirds of the votes). In any case the
parent companies will not have a veto right in respect of these
decisions. Thus, in all areas of commercial importance, decisions
can be taken by simple majority or even super majority allowing

     The figures have been deleted as they constitute business
     secrets. The turnover of all the parties together exceeded
     5,000 million Ecu.

                               - 3 -
changing alliances in the decision-making process. The only issue
which requires a unanimous vote at a general shareholders' meeting
is the amendment of the list of core businesses of EUREKO.
11. The above elements indicate that there may not be enough
grounds to consider that EUREKO is jointly controlled. Control
would become even more diluted in the event that new shareholders
joined EUREKO.
12. However, it is not necessary to definitively decide on this
point since, as it is explained below, the operation leads to the
coordination of the competitive behaviour of the parties and is
therefore not a concentration in the sense of Article 3 of the
Regulation.
Full function joint venture
13. EUREKO has been set up on an indefinite basis. The assets
that will be transferred to it - together with the human and
material resources - will in principle enable it to develop direct
non-life and life insurance business in a number of countries. It
could therefore be regarded as a joint venture performing on a
lasting basis all the functions of an autonomous economic entity.
Co-ordination of competitive behaviour
14. EUREKO and its parent companies will be active in the same
product markets with the exception that Friends' Provident is not
present in the non-life insurance market and the parent companies
will not be active in the travel insurance market, which will be
entirely transferred to EUREKO. With regard to re-insurance, the
parties' activities are marginal.
15. As far as the geographic area of activities is concerned,
there is only a slight overlap as it was agreed that, in
principle, the parent companies would retain their domestic
business while their other 'international' business would be
transferred to EUREKO. The only overlap therefore will be in
geographic areas where the parent companies are not active in a
given product market in their own countries. Thus EUREKO will be
active in the life and travel insurance markets in the UK as
Friends' Provident is only active in the non-life business**.
16. However, the following reasons lead to the conclusion that
the operation will give rise to co-ordination of the competitive
behaviour of the parties:
a)   According to the objectives of the joint venture described in
     the shareholders' agreement and in the briefing paper for the
     Commission, EUREKO must be considered, to a great extent, as
     a vehicle for the co-ordination of the parent companies:
     -   "The EUREKO joint venture is an alliance between
         companies that wish to combine their resources in order
         to provide improved services in insurance ...
**
     Material error. It should read: Thus EUREKO will be active in
     the non-life and travel insurance markets in the UK as
     Friends'Provident is only active in the life business.

                                - 4 -
      -   The long term aim of the alliance is for the shareholders
          to   achieve   increasingly     close   co-operation   and
          interdependence, thereby joining the shareholders as one
          economic and organisational group.
      -   The company will be a vehicle for the exchange of know-
          how and experience within the core business of the
          alliance ...
      -   [...]***
      EUREKO's function as an instrument for co-ordinating the
      parent companies in relation to its own business is further
      emphasised when it is taken into account that the aim of the
      initial shareholders is to seek further shareholders on the
      basis of one participant per local market. It could be the
      case that after some time EUREKO itself will not conduct
      business in the various Member States but will simply co-
      ordinate its shareholders' activities on their domestic
      markets. This could lead to a complete division of the
      markets.
b)    Even assuming that the insurance markets (with the exception
      of the re-insurance market which is considered to be
      worldwide) currently can be considered to be national, the
      operation as notified gives rise to co-ordination of the
      competitive behaviour for the following reasons:
      -   The   parties   will   be    operating   in   neighbouring
          geographical   markets   and   will,   therefore,   remain
          potential competitors. This is in particular true for
          industrial clients and large risk which do not depend
          necessarily on national insurance companies.
      -   The currently assumed existence of national markets will
          not be maintained: a gradual process of opening of
          national markets is taking place which will be aided by
          the Community harmonisation efforts in the field of
          insurance. This seems also to be confirmed by the
          parties: "with increased liberalisation of the insurance
          industry within the EC and also within the wider European
          economic area, the insurance sector within Europe is
          facing rapid change as national barriers diminish".
          Because of this opening up of the markets, the parties
          will become at least potential competitors in the near
          future.
      -   The possibility for potential competition is further
          strengthened by the fact that EUREKO will be active in
          the geographic areas of its parent companies in the
          travel insurance business and in the UK in non-life
          insurance. Having its own distribution network will
          facilitate enlargement of the product range. This seems
          to be true in particular for the UK where EUREKO will
          take over the non-life business of Topdanmark.
      -   The lack of joint control in EUREKO which limits the
          influence of each parent in the joint venture's future

        business, the potential for competitive overlapping with
        regard to industrial clients and large risks and the
        opening of their respective domestic markets are
        reflected in a non-competition clause with many
        exceptions. The principal exception is that EUREKO will
        be able to enter the home market of one of its parent
        companies with its consent, and the same applies to the
        parent companies trying to enter each other's market or
        EUREKO's area of activities, the only requirement being
        the consent of the affected party. This shows that the
        operation will only result in a partial withdrawal of the
        parent companies.
IV. CONCLUSION
17. For the above reasons, and in particular in view of the fact
that there is a risk of co-ordination which is likely to lead to
a division of markets, the Commission has concluded that the
notified operation does not constitute a concentration within the
meaning of Article 3 of the Merger Regulation and consequently
does not fall within the scope of application of that Regulation.
This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(a) of the
Merger Regulation.
18. Following the request of the parties, the Commission has
decided to examine the compatibility of the operation under
Article 85 of the EEC Treaty and will therefore treat the
notification pursuant to Article 5 of Commission Regulation No.
2367/90 as an application within the meaning of Article 2 or a
notification within the meaning of Article 4 of Regulation No. 17.
