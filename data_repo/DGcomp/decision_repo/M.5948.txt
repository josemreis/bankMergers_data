                                                                 To the notifying party
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:      Case No COMP/M.5948 - BANCO SANTANDER / RAINBOW
              Notification of 10 September 2010 pursuant to Article 4 of Council
              Regulation No 139/20041
1. On 10.09.2010, the European Commission received a notification of a proposed
    concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/20042 by which the
    undertaking Banco Santander S.A. (“Banco Santander”, Spain) intends to acquire within
    the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation control of parts of the undertaking
    The Royal Bank of Scotland Group (assets collectively referred to as "Rainbow", UK) by
    way of purchase of assets.
I.    THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
2. Santander is the parent company of an international group of banking and financial
    companies operating in the UK, Spain and some other European countries as well as in
    Latin America. It is active in retail banking, asset management, corporate and
    investment banking, treasury and insurance.
1       OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ("the Merger Regulation"). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty
        on the Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the
        replacement of "Community" by "Union" and "common market" by "internal market". The
        terminology of the TFEU will be used throughout this decision.

Commission européenne, 1049 Bruxelles, BELGIQUE / Europese Commissie, 1049 Brussel, BELGIË. Tel. +32 229 91111.

3. Rainbow consists of (i) the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc's ("RBS") branch-related
    retail and small and medium sized-enterprise ("SME") business in England and Wales, (ii)
    the NatWest branch-related retail and SME business in Scotland, along with (iii) certain
    mid-corporate customer accounts in the UK. In total, Rainbow consists of approximately
    300 branches and around 40 SME and business banking centres, including ATMs, together
    with related contracts, intellectual property and other related assets. Excluded from the
    scope of the transaction are insurance products, as well as financial market services.
4.   The sale of Rainbow business results from an undertaking submitted by the UK
    authorities as part of RBS' restructuring plan following state support approved by the
    Commission in its decision of 14 December 20093. In that decision, it is stated that the
    "UK authorities commit that the buyer of the Rainbow Business must, together with the
    rest of the buyer’s group, in combination with the Rainbow Business, have a market
    share of no more than 14% in the UK SME market (on a number of customers basis),
    prior to the signing of the sale and purchase agreements relating to the sale of the
    Rainbow Business to the buyer"4.
II.  CONCENTRATION
5. The proposed transaction will result in Santander acquiring sole control over Rainbow. As
    Rainbow is not a legal entity, the transaction is structured as an asset deal, with Santander
    acquiring the branches together with related contracts, guarantees/securities and debts
    relating to customers of those branches (together with direct customer transfers), as well as
    intellectual property, goodwill, office equipment and books and records.
6. Therefore the proposed transaction constitutes a concentration within the meaning of
    Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation 139/2004.
III. EU DIMENSION
7. The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more than
    EUR 5 billion5 (Banco Santander S.A: EUR 76 066 million; Rainbow: EUR […]). Each of
    them has a EU-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (Banco Santander S.A: EUR
    […]; Rainbow: EUR […]), but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate
    EU-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified operation therefore
    has an EU dimension.
IV. RELEVANT MARKETS
8. As Rainbow is active only in retail banking and corporate banking, overlaps with the
    activities of Santander arise in banking services to private individuals and to corporate
    customers (SME and large corporate customers)6.

    Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice (OJ C95, 16.04.2008, p1).
6   As specified in recital 3, no financial market services business is included in Rainbow. However,
    contracts relating to these services are being transferred to Santander. Given that in any event Santander is
                                                             2

9. Regarding retail and corporate banking, the Commission in previous decisions7
    considered in particular the following relevant product and geographic markets.8
     (i) Retail Banking
10. In respect of banking services for natural persons, the following segments have been
    considered: current accounts, savings, personal loans, consumer loans, credit cards9,
    debit cards, mortgages and distribution of mutual funds and other investment products10.
    Regarding the geographic definition of retail banking markets, the Commission has
    generally considered national markets11, but has also looked at, where relevant, the
    regional distribution of branches in making its assessment.12
     (ii) Banking for corporate customers
11. In respect of commercial banking services the Commission has looked at the segments
    of domestic payments, international payments, savings, loans, documentary credits,
    export financing and cash management services13. In addition, the Commission has
    made a distinction between large corporate customers ("LCCs") and smaller commercial
    clients such as SMEs14. In cases falling under the Commission's jurisdiction, the markets
    for banking services to commercial clients have been considered national in scope while
    for LCCs the question on whether the market(s) for these services are national or wider
    in scope has been left open.
12. As regards commercial clients, the Parties have provided data on the basis of customers
    with turnover of up to GBP 25m as they have indicated that this is how both parties
    a minor player in financial market services with a share of less than [0-5]% in any segment this market
    segment will not be discussed further.

    5726 - Deutsche Bank/ Sal. Oppenheim.
8   Leaving aside specialized markets which include leasing services, private banking, asset management and
    payment transaction processing. These are not analysed in the present case as according to the Parties,
    their activities in these areas do not overlap. The Commission has also looked at the markets for factoring
    and for cash handling and sales, but these markets are not affected markets in the context of the notified
    transaction.
9   In one case, COMP/M.5384 - BNP Paribas/Fortis, a separate market was identified for card-based
    revolving credit.

    distinguish internally between SMEs and large customers15. On the other hand, SMEs
    are distinguished from retail personal customers by virtue of having a dedicated
    business account. They have, however, indicated that even if a wider definition of
    commercial clients were used (up to an annual turnover of GBP 250 million), market
    shares would be substantially unchanged16.
V.       COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
13. The proposed transaction gives rise to potentially affected markets due to horizontal
    overlaps in two segments in retail banking in the UK, on the basis of new business in
    2009: (a) personal current accounts and (b) mortgages17.
14. With respect to horizontal overlaps in retail banking, other than in personal current
    accounts and mortgages, the combined market shares exceed 15% only in personal
    current accounts and mortgages (measured in both cases as share of new business).
15. For personal current accounts in the UK the combined share of new business in 2009 is
    [10-20]% (Santander: [10-20]%; Rainbow: [0-5]%)18.
16. Regarding mortgage loans, the combined share of new business in 2009 is [20-30]%
    (Santander: [10-20]%; Rainbow: [0-5]%)19.
17. In both cases, a number of strong competitors exist. In personal current accounts: Lloyds
    ([30-40]%), RBS ([10-20]%), Barclays ([10-20]%), and HSBC ([10-20]%). In mortgage
    loans: Lloyds ([20-30]%), Nationwide ([5-10]%), Barclays ([10-20]%), RBS ([10-20]%)
    and HSBC ([10-20]%)20.
18. Even if the Commission were to consider the competitive impact at a regional level, the
    picture would not change to any significant or relevant degree21.
15  According to the notification, a different team of relationship managers will service customers with a
    turnover above GBP 25m.
16  In M.4844 Fortis/ABN AMRO ASSETS, a turnover threshold of €250 million was applied based on the
    commercial practice of the Parties in that case.
17  If only share of total stock were taken into account there would be no horizontally affected markets.
    However, given that this measure compounds information from previous years, in particular for long-term
    assets and liabilities, the acquisition of new business is likely to be a better proxy for the effective
    competitive pressure currently exercised by the players in the marketplace.
18  Figures for new business in regard to personal current accounts have been provided by the Parties based
    on calculations by a third party, […], using a survey methodology in which customers were asked about
    new products taken out in the six months prior to the interview.
19  According to the Parties, Santander and other players in the UK report new gross lending as a separate
    line in their annual reports and accounts, whilst the Bank of England provides total new gross lending
    figures for the overall market. As a share of stock, the figures for 2009 are [10-20]% and [10-20]%
    respectively.
20  All market shares quoted in terms of new business in 2009.
21  The highest combined market share provided by the Parties on the basis of possible regional
    segmentations is [10-20]% for personal loans ([…]) and [20-30]% for mortgages ([…]).
                                                           4

19. None of the possible segments in corporate banking gives rise to an affected market.
    However, as the SME market in the UK was considered specifically in the state aid
    decision regarding the restructuring of RBS it may be noted that, according to the
    notifying party, the combined market shares range between [5-10]% and [10-20]% for
    any of the possible market segments within SME banking, on the basis of SME main
    bank relationships22.
20. Given the limited combined market shares that the transaction will bring about and the
    significant number of large and credible competitors, it can be concluded that the
    transaction does not raise serious doubts on any of the possible markets.
VI. RELATIONSHIP WITH STATE AID RULES
21. Based on the information available at this stage, the Commission has no indication that
    RBS is in breach of any of its obligations regarding the sale of the Rainbow business
    within the framework of the State aid procedure23. The present decision under the EU
    Merger Regulation in no way prejudices, however, the ongoing monitoring of RBS'
    implementation of its obligations in line with the above decision of the Commission of
    14 December 2009.
VII. CONCLUSION
22. For the above reasons, the European Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the internal market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger
    Regulation.
