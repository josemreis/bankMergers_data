Subject:      Case No COMP/M.6694 - HELVETIA/ CERTAIN PARTS OF GAN
              EUROCOURTAGE'S TRANSPORT AND MARINE INSURANCE
              PORTFOLIO
              Commission decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation
              No 139/20041
Dear Sir/Madam,
1. On 4 October 2012, following a referral pursuant to Article 4(5) of the Merger
    Regulation, the Commission received the notification of a proposed concentration
    pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation by which Helvetia Assurances SA
    ("Helvetia Assurances SA", France) indirectly controlled by Helvetia Holding AG
    ("Helvetia Holding", Switzerland) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the
    Merger Regulation control of part of Gan Eurocourtage SA ("the target", France) by
    way of purchase of assets2. Helvetia is designated hereinafter as the "notifying party".
1   OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ("the Merger Regulation"). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on the
    Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the replacement of
    "Community" by "Union" and "common market" by "internal market". The terminology of the TFEU will
    be used throughout this decision.

Commission européenne, 1049 Bruxelles, BELGIQUE / Europese Commissie, 1049 Brussel, BELGIË. Tel.: +32 229-91111.

(1) THE PARTIES
2. Helvetia is a pan-European insurance company active both in the life and the non-life
    insurance sectors.
3. The target is the portfolio of Gan Eurocourtage's ("GEC") Marine and Transport
    Insurance contracts (excluding aviation and space) and their related assets underwritten
    in France and various French overseas territories3.
(2) THE OPERATION
4. On 16 July 2012, GEC agreed to sell to Helvetia discrete parts of its Transport and Marine
    Insurance portfolio. The transaction consists in the purchase of the portfolio of GEC’s
    Marine and Transport Insurance contracts (excluding aviation and space) and their related
    assets underwritten in France and the various French overseas territories. More specifically,
    the transferred assets consist in (i) the French insurance transportation portfolio held by
    GEC (including current policies and future production capabilities) together with the
    related technical reserves, invested assets and reinsurance protection; (ii) other non-
    technical assets (including rights under certain other contracts, IP rights and IT
    capabilities) necessary for the operation of the French transportation portfolio; and (iii)
    the automatic transfer of 240 employees that are dedicated to the French transportation
    portfolio.
(3) CONCENTRATION
5. Following the operation Helvetia will acquire sole control over the target. The
    transaction, therefore, constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b)
    of the Merger Regulation.
(4) EU DIMENSION
6. Though the undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of
    more than EUR 5 000 million4 (Helvetia: EUR 5 826 million, Target: […]), only one of
    them has an EU-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (Helvetia: […]), whereas
    the target's aggregate EU-wide turnover is […]. The concentration also does not meet
    the thresholds laid down in Article 1(3) of the Merger Regulation: the EU-wide turnover
    of each of the two undertakings concerned is more than 25 million only in one of those
    Member States in which the combined aggregate turnover of both is more than EUR 100
    million.
7. On 21 August 2012, the Commission received, by means of a reasoned submission, a
    referral request pursuant to Article 4(5) of the Merger Regulation with respect to the
    concentration cited above. The Commission transmitted this submission to all Member
    States on 24 August 2012. The Member States competent to examine the concentration
3   GEC is a controlled subsidiary of Groupama SA.
4   Turnover calculated in accordance with Article 5 of the Merger Regulation.
                                                          2

    did not express their disagreement to the request for referral within 15 working days.
    The case is therefore deemed to have an EU dimension.
(5) COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
    Product market definitions
8. Within the insurance sector, the Commission distinguished in previous cases three
    different segments, namely: (i) life-insurance, (ii) non-life insurance and (iii)
    reinsurance5. The proposed concentration only concerns the provision of non-life
    insurance.
9. The Commission also noted that, from the demand side, life and non-life insurance can
    be sub-divided into as many potential product markets as different types of risks
    covered, as there are different kinds of risks covered, given that their characteristics,
    premiums and purposes are distinct and that there is no substitutability from the
    consumers' perspective between different risks insured6. However, the Commission
    recognized that supply-side considerations may lead to broader product markets in
    respect of certain types of risk, indicating that different types of insurance may be
    included in the same product market7.
10. In past decisions the Commission identified transport insurance as a segment of the
    wider non-life insurance branch8. Within transport insurance, the Commission envisaged
    further sub-segments by reference to the applicable national insurance classification9.
    The notifying party does not disagree with such practice and submits that the relevant
    insurance classification is consistent across those Member States where the combined
    entity will be active, i.e. Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
11. Based on the above, the parties' activities overlap in the following sub-segments: (i)
    marine hull insurance, (ii) cargo insurance and (iii) transport liability insurance10.
5   See for example Case COMP/M.5925 Metlife/Alico/Delam, paragraph 9.
6   See Case COMP/M.5925 Metlife/Alico/Delam, paragraph 10; Case COMP/M.5083 Groupama/OTP
    Garancia, paragraph 10; and Case COMP/M.5010 Berkshire Hathaway/Munich RE/GAUM, paragraph
    23.
7   See Case COMP/M.5925 Metlife/Alico/Delam, paragraph 10; and Case Comp/M.4284 AXA/Winterthur,
    paragraph 9.
8   See Case COMP/M.6217 Baloise Holding/Nateus/Nateus Life, paragraph 17; and Case COMP/M.4284
    AXA/Winterthur, paragraph 14.
9   See Case COMP/M.6217 Baloise Holding/Nateus/Nateus Life, paragraph 20.
10  For the sake of completeness, the notifying party notes that the target’s activities include insurance
    contracts covering the insurance against fire and other damage to property. Such contracts are
    underwritten to cover industrial risks, risks for goods belonging to clients (regarding buildings,
    equipment, computer science, offices, etc.), as well as goods under the client’s responsibility pursuant to
    his professional activity (e.g. stored goods). Those damaged goods insurance contracts which are
    transferred to Helvetia as part of the proposed concentration are underwritten by transporters but are not
    considered to be part of the transport insurance sector. These contracts fall within the relevant product
    market for damaged goods insurance. Helvetia is also active in this product market which means that the
    parties’ activities overlap, although this overlap is inconsequential given that the parties’ combined share
    does not exceed [0-5]% in any of the potential geographic markets (EU, EFTA, EEA, Austria, France,
    Italy, Germany and Spain).
                                                             3

12. Marine hull insurance provides coverage for damage incurred by all floating methods of
    transport. Within such a branch, the Commission also considered further potential
    product markets, i.e. sea marine hull insurance and inland marine hull insurance11. The
    former segment can be further sub-divided into marine hull insurance for sea-going
    vessels and insurance for construction risks (which covers damages caused by
    shipbuilders and repairers) and the latter can be sub-divided into marine hull insurance
    for inland crafts and insurance against damage to land-based (harbour) materials (such
    as cranes used in the context of marine transport).
13. Cargo insurance covers against the damage or loss of goods that are transported,
    irrespective of the means of transportation used.
14. Transport liability insurance covers the mandatory liability which road transporters have
    with respect to transported goods on the basis of the Convention on the Contract for the
    International Carriage of Goods by Road12.
15. According to the notifying party, it would not be appropriate to further sub-divide the
    product markets for cargo insurance and transport liability insurance by the means of
    transport involved. In fact, such segmentation would be neither meaningful nor
    practical, because most insurance contracts cover multimodal transportation within a
    single voyage. Thus, sub-divisions within the voyage itself, and according to the
    particular means of transport used for every leg of a journey, would be artificial.
16. In any event, the exact product market definitions can be left open in this case as the
    notified transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal
    market under any alternative definition.
    Geographic market definitions
17. The Commission generally defined the geographic scope of non-life insurance markets
    as national because of national distribution channels, established market structures,
    fiscal constraints and differing regulatory systems13. However, with respect to the
    geographic scope of markets related to transport insurance, the Commission indicated
    that it is likely to be wider than national for large corporate customers and large risk
    insurance respectively14. In two past decisions regarding the marine insurance sector the
    Commission considered that the market could be at least EEA-wide, but ultimately left
    the exact scope of the relevant geographic market open15.
18. The notifying party submits that each of the relevant product markets defined is indeed
    at least EEA-wide.
19. In any event, the exact geographic market definitions can be left open in this case as the
    notified transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the internal
    market under any alternative definition.

12  Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (CMR), Geneva, 19 May
    1956.
13  See for example Case COMP/M.4284 AXA/Winterthur, paragraph 17.
14  Case COMP/M.2676 Sampo/Varma Sampo/If Holding/JV, paragraph 19.

    AXA/Winterthur, paragraph 18.

    Assessment
20. The parties' activities overlap in a number of transport insurance markets, even though
    their market presence remains limited (with the exception of France).
21. At the EU level, there are no relevant product markets where the combined entity's post-
    transaction shares would be higher than 15%. The highest level of overlap created by the
    proposed concentration is in the cargo insurance market. However, even in this product
    market the combined entity's post-transaction share would remain below [10-20]%. As
    concerns the remaining overlaps, the combined entity's post-transaction shares will
    amount to [5-10]% and [5-10]% in the marine hull insurance for sea-going vessels and
    inland crafts sub-segments respectively and to [5-10]% in transport liability insurance.
    Therefore, the proposed concentration is unlikely to produce any anti-competitive
    effects in the markets concerned.
22. At a national level, post-transaction, the combined entity will have market shares below
    15% in the marine hull insurance for sea-going vessels and inland crafts sub-segments
    (Austria [0-5]% and [5-10]%, Italy [0-5]% and [0-5]%, Germany [0-5]% and [5-10]%,
    Spain [0-5]% and [0-5]%), in cargo insurance (Austria [5-10]%, France [0-5]%, Italy [0-
    5]%, Germany [0-5]%, Spain [0-5]%) and in transport liability insurance (Austria [5-
    10]%, Italy [0-5]%, Germany [5-10]%, Spain [0-5]%)16.
23. The combined entity would only have market shares above 15% in France in the marine
    hull insurance for sea-going vessels and inland crafts sub-segments ([20-30]% and [20-
    30]%) and in transport liability insurance ([20-30]%).
24. In the marine hull insurance for sea-going vessels and the inland crafts markets, the
    market share increments brought about by the proposed concentration are very small,
    due to Helvetia’s very limited presence in France (around [0-5]% and [0-5]%,
    respectively)17.
25. In a hypothetical product market (confined to France only) for transport liability
    insurance, the combined entity's post-transaction share would be ([20-30]% (Helvetia
    [10-20]%, target [10-20]%). However, the combined entity would remain the second
    largest competitor (currently, the target already is the second largest competitor) behind
    the market leader AXA ([30-40]%). The market features at least three other competitors,
    Allianz, Covéa and Generali with non-insignificant market shares ([5-10]%, [5-10]%
    and [5-10]%, respectively), as well as a number of other players such as IF, Amlin and
    Mapfre. In the light of this, the combined entity, post-transaction, will continue to face
    sufficient competitive constraints.
16  As noted above, the notifying party notes that the combined entity's post-transaction share would remain
    well below [0-5]% in the relevant market for damaged goods insurance under any of the potential
    geographic markets (EU, EFTA, EEA, Austria, France, Italy, Germany and Spain).
17  The assessment of the proposed concentration would not change under any other plausible market
    definition. The combined entity's post-transaction shares in the wider product markets for sea marine hull
    insurance and inland marine hull insurance would remain almost identical, i.e. [20-30]% and [20-30]%. In
    the even wider market for marine hull insurance (created through the re-grouping of sea marine hull
    insurance and inland marine hull insurance), the analysis would not change, as the combined entity's post-
    transaction share would amount to [20-30]%.

(6) CONCLUSION
26. For the above reasons, the European Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the internal market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger
    Regulation.
