Dear Sir or Madam,
1.      On 30 May 2018, the European Commission received notification of a proposed
        concentration pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation by which Francisco Partners
        Management LP (“Francisco Partners”, US) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b)
        of the Merger Regulation sole control of the whole of VeriFone Systems, Inc. (“VeriFone”,
        US) by way of purchase of shares.3
2.      The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
        <U+F02D>     Francisco Partners: a private equity firm exclusively focused on investments in
              software and technology-enabled businesses,
        <U+F02D>     VeriFone: primarily active in the design, manufacture and supply of point of sale
              (“POS”) payment devices and related services.
3.      After examination of the notification, the European Commission has concluded that the
        notified operation falls within the scope of the Merger Regulation and of paragraph 5(c) of
        the Commission Notice on a simplified procedure for treatment of certain concentrations
        under Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004.4
4.      For the reasons set out in the Notice on a simplified procedure, the European Commission
        has decided not to oppose the notified operation and to declare it compatible with the

        throughout this decision.
