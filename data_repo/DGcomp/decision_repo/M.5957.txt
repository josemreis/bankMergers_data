1.   On 6 August 2010, the European Commission received notification of a proposed
     concentration pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation by which the undertakings
     Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Fund VIII, L.P. ("CD&R Fund VIII", Cayman Islands) and The
     Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ("Goldman Sachs", United States of America) acquire within the
     meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation joint control of the undertaking
     Harrington Group, Inc. ("HGI", United States of America) by way of purchase of shares.
2.   The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
1       OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ("the Merger Regulation"). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on the
        Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the replacement of
        "Community" by "Union" and "common market" by "internal market". The terminology of the TFEU will
        be used throughout this decision.
