  general description.                                            ARTICLE 6(1)(b) DECISION
                                                                To the notifying party:
Dear Sirs,
Subject:        Case No COMP/M.5031 - ACE / CICA
                Notification of 8.02.2008. pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                No 139/20041
1. On 8 February 2008, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
      concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (the
      Merger Regulation) by which the undertaking ACE Limited ("ACE", Cayman Islands)
      acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation control of the
      whole of the undertaking Combined Insurance Company of America ("CICA", USA) by
      way of purchase of shares.
2. After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the operation
      falls within the scope of the Merger Regulation and does not raise serious doubts as to
      its compatibility with the common market and the EEA agreement.
(1) THE PARTIES
3. ACE, a Bermuda-based holding company incorporated with limited liability under the
      Cayman Islands company law, is a global property and casualty insurance and
      reinsurance organization. In Europe it offers a broad range of non-life insurance
      products including, inter alia, property, casualty, and accident and health, to
      corporations and individual consumers. ACE also provides life and non-life reinsurance
      services in Europe.
4. CICA is a USA based provider of life insurance, accident and health insurance products
      primarily to individuals in the US, EU, Canada and Asia Pacific. Within the EEA, CICA
      provides insurance services (almost exclusively accident and health insurance) in
      Austria, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom

II.   THE OPERATION
5. CICA is currently fully owned by the Aon Corporation (“Aon”). Through a Stock
    Purchase Agreement ("SPA") signed between Aon and ACE on 14 December 2007, Aon
    has agreed to sell to ACE and ACE has agreed to buy from Aon all the issued and
    outstanding capital stock of CICA2.
6. Therefore, the proposed concentration constitutes an acquisition of sole control of CICA
    by ACE and the notified operation constitutes a concentration within the meaning of
    Article 3(4) of the Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
7. The transaction has a Community dimension pursuant to Article 1(2) of the Merger
    Regulation. The parties have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover of more than
    €5,000 million (ACE € 9,418 million, CICA € 1,380 million) and each of them has a
    Community-wide turnover in excess of € 250 million (ACE € […], CICA € […]). None
    of the parties achieves more than two thirds of its Community-wide turnover in the same
    Member State.
8. Based on the above, the notified operation constitutes a concentration within the
    meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
IV. THE RELEVANT MARKETS
       A.     Relevant product markets
9. In Europe both ACE and CICA are active in the life and non-life insurance sector.
    Moreover, ACE also provides life and non-life reinsurance services in Europe.
10. In previous decisions, the Commission has distinguished between the provision of
    insurance products into life insurance, non-life insurance and reinsurance3.
11. The Commission suggested as well that the above mentioned markets can be further
    divided into as many product markets as there are different kinds of risks covered.
12. Accordingly, in recent cases, the Commission has reviewed data on a number of
    "hypothetical" non-life insurance markets, such as the accident and health (A&H)
2   With the exception of Sterling Life Insurance Company, active only in the US, which will be sold by
    AON, through a separate transaction to the Munich Re Group.

    insurance, workers' compensation, and insurance against fire and other damage to
    property4. The Commission did not need to reach a definitive view on the issue.
13. Moreover, the Commission has also reviewed data on certain "hypothetical" life
    insurance markets, comprising individual protection, group protection, personal
    pensions, group pensions, and savings5, again without reaching a definitive view on the
    issue.
14. With respect to life insurance, the Commission has in recent cases distinguished
    between group life insurance products and individual life insurance.6
15. According to the notifying party, the distinction between group and individual insurance
    policies is not meaningful insofar as the underlying products essentially cover the same
    basic risks either for an individual on his or her own or for an individual as an employee
    of a company. The distinction relates mainly to how underwriters choose to market their
    products. Therefore, nothing prevents insurance companies from moving into the other
    distribution avenues.
16. As regards reinsurance, the Commission has left open whether reinsurance constitutes a
    single relevant product market or whether it might be further sub-divided into life and
    non-life segments. It has also reviewed share data according to class of risk (e.g.,
    liability, motor, property, etc.)7.
17. The exact product market definitions can be left open as no competition concerns arise
    in any alternative product market definition.
        B.        Relevant geographic markets
18. In past decisions8, whilst recognising that life and non-life insurance markets are
    becoming more open to intra-Community competition, the Commission has held that
    they are still generally national in scope due to the national distribution channels, the
    established market structures, fiscal constraints and differing regulatory systems.
19. As regards reinsurance, the Commission has previously found that the scope of the
    relevant geographic market is global9.
20. The exact geographic market definitions can be left open as the proposed transaction
    does not lead to competition concerns on any alternative geographic market definition.

V.      COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
        A.        Horizontal overlaps
      Non-life Insurance
21. ACE and CICA's activities overlap in non-life insurance in Germany, Ireland, Portugal,
    Spain and the United Kingdom. In all of these countries, on the basis of premiums
    written, their combined market shares are minimal, ranging from [<1]% to [0-5]%.
22. In the "hypothetical" accident & health ("A&H") insurance segment of the non-life
    insurance market, ACE and CICA's activities overlap in Germany, Ireland, Spain and
    the United Kingdom. Their combined market shares on this hypothetical product
    market, on the basis of premiums written, range from [0-5]% to [5-10]% (in Ireland).
23. When considering a further "hypothetical" distinction of the A&H insurance segment
    into (i) group A&H insurance and (ii) individual A&H insurance, ACE and CICA have
    a combined market share exceeding 15% on the sub-segment of individual A&H
    insurance in Ireland. On the basis of net premiums written their combined share amounts
    to [15-25]% (CICA [15-25]%, ACE [<1]%).
24. However, the increment due to this transaction is only [<1]%. Therefore the increase in
    market share is not significant and the probability to impede competition on the
    individual A&H insurance market is low.10
25. The post-transaction HHI would be [3500-4500] with a delta of only [20-30]. The post-
    transaction HHI is above 2,000 but with a delta of less than 150, therefore the
    concentration level falls well within the safe harbours identified in the Commission's
    Horizontal Merger Guidelines.11
26. Moreover, there are sufficient alternative suppliers in a fully competitive market. The
    biggest individual A&H provider is VHI (Voluntary Health Insurance), a state-owned
    health insurance provider that will remain by far the largest supplier with an estimated
    market share of […] %. Other suppliers of individual A&H insurance in Ireland and their
    respective market shares are: Quinn Group ([10-15]%), Irish Life ([0-5]%), FDB ([0-5]%),
    AXA ([0-5]%), Cardiff Pinacle ([0-5]%), Friends First ([0-5]%) and VIVAS health ([0-
    5]%).
27. Therefore, the proposed transaction will not significantly change the structure of A&H
    insurance (especially the hypothetical individual A&H insurance segment) in Ireland
    and will not raise any competition concern.
    Life Insurance
28. According to the notifying party, the only country in which both ACE and CICA are
    active in life insurance is the United Kingdom. CICA's market share for 2006
10  Para. 27, Guidelines on assessment of horizontal mergers under the Council Regulation on the control of
    concentrations between undertakings, O.J. C 31/03, 5.2.2004. p. 7.
11  Para. 20, Ibid.
                                                        4

    represented less than [0-5]% of life insurance premiums in the United Kingdom. ACE
    started providing life insurance in the United Kingdom in late 200712.
29. Therefore, the proposed transaction does not give rise to an affected market in life
    insurance.
        B.        Vertical overlaps
30. According to the notifying party ACE’s (via its subsidiary ACE Tempest Re),
    worldwide market share in reinsurance would amount to [0-5]%. Even if the reinsurance
    market was further segmented into life and non-life insurance (or according to the class
    of risk insured), ACE would have a worldwide share below 25% in both life
    reinsurances and non-life reinsurances.
VI. CONCLUSION
31. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation
    and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA Agreement.
    This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No
    139/2004.

12  If ACE's 2007 sales are applied to the overall 2006 data, ACE sales would also account for less than
    0.01% of life insurance in the United Kingdom.
