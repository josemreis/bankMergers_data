  general
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:        Case No COMP/M.5010 – Berkshire Hathaway/ Munich Re/ GAUM
                Notification of 9 June 2008 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                No 139/20041
1. On 9 June 2008, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
      pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (the Merger Regulation)
      by which the undertakings Northern States Agency, Inc., a wholly owned indirect
      subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ("Berkshire Hathaway", USA), and Münchener
      Rückversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG ("Munich Re", Germany) acquire, within the
      meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation, joint control of the undertaking
      Global Aerospace Underwriting Managers Ltd ("GAUM", UK), by way of purchase of
      shares.
I.     THE PARTIES
2. Berkshire Hathaway is a US based company engaged in a number of diverse business
      activities, including property and casualty insurance business conducted on both a direct
      and reinsurance basis.
3. Munich Re is a German company active in reinsurance, direct insurance and asset
      management.
4. GAUM is a company that provides management services including underwriting, claims
      and other services, to an aerospace insurance underwriting pool i.e. the Global Pool and
      also to third parties. Currently, the members of the Global Pool are Berkshire Hathaway,
      Munich Re, Tokio Marine and Mitsui Sumitomo.

II.   THE OPERATION
5. The proposed concentration concerns a change of control of GAUM, from joint control by
    Berkshire Hathaway and Converium2 (Munich Re being a minority shareholder) to joint
    control by Berkshire Hathaway and Munich Re.
6. The proposed transaction is a result of the acquisition of Converium by SCOR,3 which,
    according to the GAUM Pool Members' Agreement and the GAUM Shareholders'
    Agreement, triggered provisions related to change of control.
7. Subsequently, on 22 April 2008 the Parties, by signature of the Share Purchase Agreement,
    agreed to acquire the Converium shares in GAUM conditional upon the obtaining of
    required clearances and approvals.
8. Following the proposed transaction, Berkshire Hathaway will own 60% of the shares and
    Munich Re will own the remaining 40%. GAUM's Shareholders' Agreement provides that
    decisions concerning the approval of the budget and the business plan are to be passed by a
    majority of the shareholders holding more than 75% of the shares. Therefore, Berkshire
    Hathaway and Munich Re acquire joint control over GAUM.
9. As the activities of GAUM will not change the joint venture will remain a full-function
    joint-venture.
10. On the basis of the above, the transaction constitutes a concentration within in the meaning
    of Article 3(1) (b) of the Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
11. The transaction has a Community dimension pursuant to Article 1(2) of the Merger
    Regulation. The Parties have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover in excess of €5 bn
    (in 2006, Berkshire Hathaway € 78.5 bn, Munich Re € 37.4 bn) and a Community-wide
    turnover in excess of €250 million (Berkshire €[…], Munich €[…]).4 Neither of the Parties
    realizes more than two-thirds of its Community-wide turnover in any single Member State
    of the EU.
IV. RELEVANT MARKETS
12. The proposed transaction concerns three markets: insurance, reinsurance, and the provision
    of underwriting services (including claims) and management services to insurers and
    reinsurers ("underwriting and management services"). In order to assess the market shares
    and exact market definition a market investigation has been carried out by the Commission
    among main brokers, customers and competitors of the Parties.
13. In respect of both the aerospace insurance and reinsurance business written by GAUM, it
    needs to be borne in mind that, as the market investigation in the present case has

    on the calculation of turnover (OJ C66, 2.3.1998, p25).

    confirmed, this business is typically written in coinsurance between a number of insurers or
    reinsurers, using the procedure known as subscription. The Commission analyzed this
    practice in its recent final report on the Sector Inquiry into Business Insurance.5
Underwriting and management services
Product market
14. The Parties provide underwriting and claim management services to insurance and
    reinsurance providers. They argue that the relevant product market is the provision of
    underwriting and management services for all classes of risk, not just aerospace insurance
    or reinsurance.
15. In a previous Commission decision, Berkshire Hathaway/Converium/Gaum/JV, the
    market for underwriting and management services was considered as a market distinct from
    the provision of insurance and reinsurance.6 The Commission also noted that many insurers
    provided these services in-house and concluded that there may also be an outsourcing
    market for such services, which was particularly relevant for insurance pools as an
    alternative to relying on one company.
16. The Commission also considered whether the market for underwriting and management
    services should be further subdivided to the provision of such services in respect of
    aerospace insurance, but was able, in the context of the case to leave this question open.7
17. The current market investigation confirmed the existence of a possible segment of
    underwriting and management services for aerospace risk insurance and a number of
    respondents pointed out that underwriting and management services for satellite/space risk
    could be a possible sub-segment, as these services require special knowledge and expertise.
18. The Parties have also argued that the relevant market should be enlarged to include services
    provided internally by insurers, i.e. captive provision of the same services. Whilst the
    Commission recognizes, however, the similarity in the services provided between entities
    that act on the market as pure agents and entities that provide these services in-house it
    requested the Parties to provide also market share excluding captive use.
19. However, for the purposes of the present decision it is not necessary to conclude on the
    exact definition of the relevant product market, since, even on the narrowest definition
    considered, namely the provision of underwriting and management services in respect of
    aerospace risks by entities that act exclusively as agents or provision of such services to
    satellite/space insurers, no competition concerns have been raised.

    and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Sector Inquiry under Article 17 of Regulation

20. The Parties argue that the market for providing underwriting and management services to
    aerospace risk insurance is at least EEA-wide, and probably worldwide, in scope. This is in
    line with previous Commission Decision M.30358 and the market investigation in the
    current case.
Insurance
Product market
21. Berkshire Hathaway and Munich Re are both active on the insurance market and argue that
    the relevant product market is the market for all direct insurances.
22. This is not in line with the Commission's practice. In numerous previous decisions, the
    Commission has distinguished between life insurance and non-life insurance.9 Both parties
    are active in non-life insurance, only Munich Re is active in life insurance.
23. Regarding non-life insurance the Commission has observed that, from the demand side,
    there are as many different product markets as there are different kinds of risks covered,
    such as aerospace, marine, commercial and real estate etc. since their characteristics,
    premiums and purposes' are distinct and there is typically no substitutability from the
    customer's perspective between the different risks insured. The Commission has noted,
    however, a degree of similarity on the supply side of non-life insurance and that most large
    insurers are active in several classes of insurance, factors which might argue for a wider
    market definition.10
24. In previous decisions, however, the Commission has also noted that even if supply-side
    substitution might operate over a range of risks, and particularly in industrial insurance,
    certain types of insurance by virtue of their specific characteristics may be an exception to
    this rule. The latter might in particular include large industrial risks. In the Berkshire
    Hathaway/Converium/Gaum/JV decision it was suggested, but not finally decided upon,
    that this could apply to aerospace insurance. It was left open whether aerospace insurance
    itself needed to be further divided into individual segments11.

25. On request of the Commission the Parties provided the following eventual segmentation of
    the aerospace risk insurance:12
      a) airline risks, i.e. cover for hull damage and passenger and third party liability;
      b) product and airport risks, i.e. insurance provided to product manufacturers,
           airport authorities, service providers and component manufacturers as well as
           refuelling and fuelling activities;
      c) general aviation risks, i.e. cover for hull and liability for all aircraft not operated
           by airlines (such as private and corporate jets, air taxi services, and occasional
           charters);
      d) banks (financial)/non-ownership risks, i.e. (residual) insurance of the legal
           owners of aircraft when these are not their users (this mainly refers to banks and
           leasing companies) ;
      e) satellite/space risks.
26. The market investigation confirmed that the aerospace risk insurance could constitute a
    separate market of non-life insurance. A number of companies pointed out in the market
    investigation that satellite/space risk insurance could be distinguished as a sub-segment of
    aerospace risk insurance due to the experienced personnel required in order to provide this
    kind of insurance.
27. However, for the purpose of this case, it is not necessary to decide on the exact definition of
    the relevant product market since whatever market definition is considered the transaction
    does not raise any competition concerns.
Geographic market
28. The Parties submit that provision of aerospace insurance as well as its possible segments
    should be regarded world-wide or, at the very least, EEA-wide as distribution channels are
    established on an international basis.
29. In previous decisions the geographic scope of non-life insurance has generally been held to
    be national,13 with the exception, however, of the markets for insurance of large
    commercial risks.14 Also, in the Berkshire Hathaway/Converium/Gaum/JV case, the
    Commission found that the market for the provision of aerospace risk insurance was most
    likely at least EEA-wide.15
30. In the present case, most respondents to the market investigation agreed that, due to
    distribution channels organised on international level the market for aerospace risk
    insurance market is at least EEA-wide. However, it is not necessary to decide on the exact
12  The Parties noted three further categories, namely hull war insurance, hull deductible insurance, and
    excess war third party liability coverage, but since the notified transaction did not lead to material
    overlaps in respect of these segments, they are not considered further.

                                                           5

    geographic scope of the market since, on the assumption that it is at least EEA-wide, no
    competition concerns have been raised regardless of the exact geographic market definition.
Reinsurance
Product market
31. Both Berkshire Hathaway and Munich Re are active on the reinsurance market and
    suggested that the relevant product market should not be further segmented by type of
    reinsurance.
32. In previous decisions the Commission has left open whether reinsurance constitutes a single
    relevant product market or whether it might be further sub-divided into life and non-life
    segments. It has also reviewed market share data according to class of risk (e.g., liability,
    motor, property, etc.), without, however, concluding that these constituted separate product
    markets.16
33. In the present case, the market investigation tends to suggest that the relevant market was
    wider than a possible market for aerospace reinsurance, since most reinsurers are active in
    many classes of risk and able to move into a new class within a comparatively short period
    of time. However, a number of respondents pointed out that aerospace risk reinsurance
    could be a possible segment of the reinsurance market since its provision requires specific
    expertise and knowledge.
34. In any case, the precise market definition can be left open in the present case, since, even on
    the narrowest market definition considered, namely that of aerospace reinsurance, serious
    doubts do not arise as to the compatibility of the notified transaction with the common
    market.
Geographic market
35. In previous decisions the Commission has affirmed that the geographic market for the
    supply of reinsurance is global due to the need to pool risks on a global basis.17 The Parties
    have stated that they agree with the view of the Commission and the results of the market
    investigation also confirm the view that the market for reinsurance, including the aerospace
    risk insurance, is worldwide.
V.    COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
36. In the present instance, it needs to be considered that Berkshire Hathaway and Munich
    Re provide insurance and reinsurance not only directly, but also through their
    membership in the Global Pool, for which GAUM acts as agent.
37. According to the information submitted by the Parties, using 2006 figures which were the
    latest complete figures available to the Parties, and based on the conclusions as to
16  See, e.g., COMP/M.4059 Swiss Re/GE Insurance Solutions.
17  Case No IV/M.1306 - Berkshire Hathaway/General Re; Case No COMP/M.4059 - Swiss Re/GE
    Insurance Solutions.
                                                     6

    potentially relevant markets set out above, the proposed transaction gives rise to horizontal
    overlaps and to two potentially affected markets, namely in aerospace underwriting and
    management services and aerospace reinsurance. The Parties acknowledged, however,
    that these figures were only their best estimates. Accordingly, and as explained below, the
    market investigation has shown that also two potential market segments within aerospace
    insurance could be affected i.e. space/satellite and banks (definition see paragraph 26).
Underwriting and management services
38. The Parties combined market share on the overall underwriting and management services
    market is below [0-5]% on a worldwide and EEA-wide level.
39. If the relevant product market is to be limited only to the provision of services for
    aerospace risk (re)insurance including captive use, the parties estimate their combined
    worldwide market shares at around [10-20]% (GAUM: [0-10]%, Berkshire Hathaway:
    [0-10]%, Munich Re: [0-5]%). At EEA level, the parties indicate a combined market
    shares of around [10-20]% (GAUM: [0-10]%, Berkshire Hathaway: [0-10]%, Munich
    Re: [0-10]%).
40. If the relevant product market is defined even more narrowly, as that of underwriting
    and management services provided by external suppliers (disregarding self-supply of
    underwriting and management services) in the aerospace (re)insurance field the
    respective combined market shares would be [30-40]% on a worldwide market (GAUM:
    [20-30]%, Berkshire Hathaway: [0-10]%, Munich Re: less than [0-10]%). On an EEA-
    wide market their combined market share would be [30-40]% (GAUM: [10-20]%,
    Berkshire Hathaway: [10-20]%, Munich Re: less than [0-5]%).
41. Although the Parties clearly disagreed with further segmentation of the aerospace risk
    insurance, they provided their best estimates on the sub-segment of underwriting to
    space/satellite risk. The estimated market share on this sub-segment would be less than [20-
    30]% (GAUM: <[0-10]%, Munich Re: < [10-20]% and Berkshire Hathaway: < [0-5]%).
42. It should, however, be noted that, Berkshire's incentives to provide these services
    independently do not change materially as a result of the present transaction and that the
    increment due to Munich Re becomes marginal.
43. Even if the above relevant market does not include the provision of analogous services in
    respect of other classes of insurance, it may well be that the ability to switch to self-supply
    or for an existing integrated insurer to enter the outsourcing market is sufficient to constrain
    GAUM and would not, therefore, lead to increased prices for this kind of service.
44. The results of market investigation show that it would not be very difficult for such an
    integrated insurer to quickly enter the outsourcing market if it had an incentive to do so.
    During the market investigation, none of the relatively few potential customers for this type
    of service expressed concerns as to the impact of the notified transaction on the availability
    or terms of the service.
45. Finally, the Parties cite one example of a recent new entry to the market (Starr Managing
    Agents Ltd.), suggesting its contestability.
46. Given all of the above, the proposed transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its
    compatibility with the common market.
                                                     7

Insurance
47. It would only be on two very narrow markets for Space/Satellite insurance and the market
    for Banks as defined in paragraph 25 that the proposed transaction would lead to affected
    markets.
48. On a possible segment of space/satellite insurance the Parties have a combined market share
    of around [10-20]% on a worldwide level (GAUM: [0-5]%, Berkshire Hathaway: [0-5]%,
    Munich Re: [10-20]%). On an EEA-wide level their market share would also be around
    [10-20]% (GAUM: [0-5]%, Berkshire Hathaway: [0-5]%, Munich Re: [10-20]%).
49. On a possible "bank" segment within aerospace insurance the Parties have a combined
    market share of [20-30]% on a worldwide level (GAUM: [10-20]%, Berkshire Hathaway:
    [10-20]%, Munich Re: [0-5]%). On an EEA-wide level their market share would
    increase to around [30-40]% (GAUM: [10-20]%, Berkshire Hathaway: [10-20]%,
    Munich Re: [0-10]%).
50. The market investigation confirmed a significant number of insurers active on the market
    for aerospace risk insurance. Respondents pointed out that switching suppliers for
    aerospace insurance is not difficult due to the limited duration of contracts (in general 1
    year) and the barriers to entry for potential insurance providers were considered low.
51. The market investigation has also confirmed that a significant number of strong
    international players, such as ACE, AIG or Allianz supply aerospace risk insurance with the
    similar possibility to place premiums in lead capacity as the Parties.
52. Finally it should be noted that none of the customers of aerospace insurance surveyed
    during the market investigation, and no broker, raised substantive concerns in relation to
    any creation of market power as a result of notified transaction.
53. Based on all of the above considerations, it can be concluded that the proposed transaction
    does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market within the
    insurance market or any submarket thereof.
                                                      8

Reinsurance
54. The Parties estimate that their combined market share in reinsurance on a worldwide level
    is around [10-20]% (GAUM: [0-5]%, Berkshire Hathaway: [0-10]%, Munich Re: [10-
    20]%). Their combined market shares for the non-life reinsurance and aerospace risk
    reinsurance are around [10-20]% respectively. The market investigation confirmed that that
    there is a significant number of reinsurers active on the aerospace reinsurance market and
    taking into consideration a limited duration of contracts switching suppliers for aerospace
    reinsurance is not difficult.
55. The market investigation has also confirmed that a significant number of strong
    international players exist in the market with the ability to act as lead reinsurer on aerospace
    risks and, thus, to act as a competitive constraint to the Parties. These include La Reunion
    Aerienne, Allianz, AIG, Swiss Re.
56. Finally it should be noted that none of the insurer customers of reinsurance surveyed during
    the market investigation, despite being sophisticated customers, raised substantive concerns
    in relation to any creation of market power as a result of the notified transaction. The same
    applies to all of the reinsurance brokers surveyed.
57. Based on all of the above considerations, it can be concluded that the proposed transaction
    does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market within the
    reinsurance market or any submarket thereof.
VI. COOPERATIVE EFFECTS OF JV
58. In the present case also the possibility of co-operative effects between the Parties have to be
    considered as the article 2(5) of the Merger Regulation requires the Commission to take
    into account in this respect, inter alia, the activities of the parent companies both in the
    same market as that in which GAUM is active and in any market upstream to it.
59. The provision of insurance and reinsurance as principal are upstream to the provision of
    underwriting and management services to insurers and reinsurers. Moreover there is a direct
    vertical commercial relationship between the Parties and GAUM via the membership of the
    Parties in the Global Pool.
60. The Parties market shares in underwriting and management services for aerospace risk
    insurance and reinsurance are, as stated above, only around [10-20]%. Further, it has to be
    borne in mind that the transaction is a change of control in a pre-existing company and not a
    combination of two or more competitors which would result in the removal of one of those
    undertakings from the market.
61. Also, as for the possible vertical relationships are concerned, Munich Re and Berkshire
    Hathaway are both active in provision of insurance and reinsurance which are upstream
    from GAUM's underwriting and management services. In the narrowest possible market,
    which is aerospace risk insurance, Munich Re and Berkshire Hathaway have market share
    around [0-10]% and in aerospace risk reinsurance they have around [10-20]%. However,
    both insurance and reinsurance markets of aerospace risk are characterised by over
    capacity. Also, the Parties claim that GAUM will not share any sensitive information about
    the markets through the joint venture as it does not disclose its underwriting terms and
    prices to individual Pool Members or shareholders.

62. Also, the market investigation pointed out that the transaction is not expected to diminish
    the incentives of the controlled entity to compete as independent players in any relevant
    market and thus lead, by withdrawal or weakening of a competitive force, to a
    concentration of that market which might then result in a significant impediment to
    effective competition.
63. Further, as seen above in the previous section, there are a significant number of independent
    competitors in the markets where Parties are present.
64. Therefore, even if the concentration increased the risk of coordination, this would not afford
    the Parties the possibility of restricting the competition in the market for underwriting and
    management services to aerospace risk insurance/reinsurance as well as market for
    aerospace insurance and reinsurance. Hence it can be concluded that the proposed
    transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market as
    to its possible coordination effects.
VII. CONCLUSION
65. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation
    and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA Agreement.
    This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No
    139/2004.
