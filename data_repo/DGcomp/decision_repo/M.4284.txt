   To the notifying party
   Dear Sir/Madam,
   Subject:       Case No. COMP/M.4284 - AXA/WINTERTHUR
                  Notification of 20 July 2006 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                  No 139/20041
 I. INTRODUCTION
   1. On 20 July 2006, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
        pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (“Merger Regulation”) by
        which the undertaking AXA S.A. (“AXA”, France) acquires within the meaning of Article
        3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation sole control of the whole of the undertaking “Winterthur”
        Swiss Insurance Company (“Winterthur”, Switzerland) which is a wholly-owned subsidiary
        of Credit Suisse Group (Switzerland) by way of purchase of shares.
   2. After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the operation
        falls within the scope of the Merger Regulation and does not raise serious doubts as to its
        compatibility with the Common Market and the EEA Agreement.
II. THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
   3. AXA is an international group active in the provision of life and non-life insurance and
        related financial services primarily in Western Europe, North America, the Asia Pacific
        Region, the Middle East and Africa.

   Commission européenne, B-1049 Bruxelles / Europese Commissie, B-1049 Brussel - Belgium. Telephone: (32-2) 299 11 11.

    4. Winterthur is an international group active in the provision of non-life insurance products
       and services, predominantly in Europe and the United States of America, and life
       insurance and pension products and services in Europe and selected Asian markets.
    5. The operation consists of the acquisition by AXA of all of the issued and outstanding
       shares of Winterthur from Credit Suisse. As a result, AXA will acquire sole control over
       Winterthur. The present operation therefore constitutes a concentration within the
       meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
    6. The transaction has a Community dimension pursuant to Article 1(2) of the Merger
       Regulation.2 The parties have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover in excess of
       €5,000 million (AXA over €71 billion, Winterthur over €13 billion), and each party has a
       Community-wide turnover in excess of €250 million (AXA over €41 billion and
       Winterthur over €5 billion). The parties concerned did not achieve more than two thirds of
       their Community-wide turnover in one and the same Member State.
IV. RELEVANT MARKETS
    A.   Relevant product markets
    7. The transaction concerns the insurance sector. In its previous decisions, the Commission
       has distinguished between three large categories of insurance products: life insurance,
       non-life insurance and reinsurance3. This distinction has been confirmed by the
       Commission’s market investigation.
    8. Although the Commission has not previously definitively concluded on the matter, it has
       been suggested that life and non-life insurance can be divided into as many product
       markets as there are different kinds of risks covered, given that their characteristics,
       premiums and purposes are distinct and that there is typically no substitutability from the
       consumer’s perspective between certain different risks insured, e.g. life-individual, life-
       group and unit linked for life insurance; motor, fire, transport, health, property, general
       civil liability, casualty, litigation, working accidents etc. for non-life insurance4.

9. However, the Commission has also recognised that from a supply-side perspective the
    conditions for insurance of different types of risk are quite similar and most large
    insurance companies are active in several types of risk. This suggests that different types
    of non-life insurance could be included in the same product market5. The Commission
    also considered that a similar approach might apply to life insurance.6
10. The market investigation has largely confirmed the Commission’s general approach. Only
    few respondents pointed out that even from a supply side perspective different life and
    non-life products needed different kinds of expertise and could therefore not be
    considered as substitutable.
11. The parties consider that whereas the high level of supply-side substitutability indicates
    that all life insurance may constitute a relevant product market, from the demand-side, a
    distinction could be drawn between group life insurance products and individual life
    insurance products. Another possible distinction between life insurance products could be
    to categorise them into protection products, pension products and savings and investment
    products.
12. Most respondents confirmed that within life insurance, one should distinguish between
    group life insurance products and individual life insurance products because of, inter alia,
    different customers’ needs and the legal framework. As far as a distinction between
    protection products, pension products and savings and investment products is concerned,
    the results of the market investigation are not conclusive.
13. For non-life insurance the parties submit that product markets can be defined according to
    the type of risk insured. Therefore, the parties have considered what their combined
    position would be based on the narrowest likely product markets in non-life insurance.
14. Specifically for the Belgian non-life insurance market7, the majority of respondents agreed
    with the parties’ view that one could distinguish the following categories (i) accident &
    health insurance, (ii) workers’ compensation, (iii) third party liability (“TPL”) motor
    insurance, (iv) non-TPL motor insurance, (v) insurance against fire and other damage to
    property, (vi) liability insurance, (vii) legal protection insurance and (viii) transport
    insurance. It should be noted that several respondents considered that categories (iii) and
    (iv) should be regarded as one segment only since these types of insurance products are
    usually sold together in a package.
15. Concerning the distribution of insurance products, in its earlier decisions the Commission
    left the product market definition open8. The parties submit that the relevant market for
    either non-life or life insurance distribution would comprise all outward (i.e. third party or

7   The market investigation focused on the Belgian insurance market, where the present operation gives raise
    to affected markets.

      non-owned) distribution channels, such as brokers, agents and other intermediaries. The
      sales force and office network of insurance companies themselves, pursuant to which
      insurance providers directly sell products to end-customers, would not come within this
      definition as they form an inherent part of the insurance companies’ normal business. This
      has been confirmed by the market investigation.
  16. For the purpose of this case the Commission can leave the exact product market
      definitions open as the transaction does not lead to any competitive concerns.
  B.    Relevant geographical markets
  17. The Commission in its previous decisions has defined the markets for life and non-life
      insurance as being mainly national in scope as a result of national distribution channels,
      the established market structures, fiscal constraints and differing regulatory systems9. For
      the purpose of the present operation the parties have considered life and non-life insurance
      markets on a national basis, except for marine and aerospace risk insurance, which the
      parties have considered to be at least EEA-wide in scope. The parties consider reinsurance
      to be worldwide in scope or at least EEA-wide.
  18. The market investigation has confirmed that in general the relevant geographical markets
      for life and non-life insurance can still be considered as mainly national. As to marine and
      aerospace risk insurance and reinsurance, all respondents have confirmed that these
      markets are at least EEA-wide in scope.
  19. The parties consider that the markets for the distribution of most insurance products can
      be regarded as national in scope. This follows from the fact that life and non-life insurance
      markets are themselves national in scope. The Commission has also recognised the
      national nature of insurance distribution channels in previous decisions10. This has largely
      been confirmed by the market investigation.
  20. For the purpose of this case the Commission can leave the exact geographic market
      definitions open as the transaction does not lead to any competitive concerns.
V. ASSESSMENT
  21. The parties have overlapping activities in the life and non-life insurance markets in
      Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and the Netherlands. In the UK, the parties’
      activities overlap in the life insurance market only. The present concentration however
      does not give raise to any affected market within the EEA except in several non-life
      insurance markets in Belgium and in motor insurance in Luxembourg.
  22. As far as reinsurance is concerned, Winterthur is not active in providing reinsurance and
      AXA is in the process of selling its reinsurance business (AXA RE). Therefore, this
      market is not considered further.

      Assicurazioni/Lloyd Italico, Decision 15/03/2001.
  10  See Case No. COMP/M.1307 – Marsh & McLennan/Sedgwick, Decision 23/10/1999; Case No.
      COMP/M.2225, Fortis/ASR, Decision 13/12/2000.

    Luxembourg
23. According to the parties’ estimates, their combined market share in the overall non-life
    insurance market in 2004 in Luxembourg is [10-20]%.11 Only in the TPL motor insurance
    and non-TPL motor insurance their combined market share slightly exceeds 15%. In all
    three hypothetical segments (i.e. TPL motor insurance, non-TPL motor insurance, both
    segments combined) the parties’ combined market share would be approximately [10-
    20]%.
24. Considering the parties position in this market and the presence of strong competitors
    such as Foyer Assurances and LA Luxembourgeoise (with more than [25-35]% of the
    motor insurance market), the present operation is unlikely to significantly impede
    effective competition in Luxembourg.
    Belgium
25. The transaction will result in the creation of the biggest non-life insurance provider in
    Belgium with a post merger combined market share of [20-30]% (AXA – [10-20]%;
    Winterthur – [0-10]%), based on 2004 data. 12
26. Based on the narrowest (hypothetical) product market definitions, the transaction will give
    rise to eight horizontal affected markets in the non-life insurance sector in Belgium: (i)
    accident & health insurance; (ii) workers’ compensation; (iii) third party liability (“TPL”)
    motor insurance; (iv) non-TPL motor insurance; (v) insurance against fire and other
    damage to property; (vi) liability insurance; (vii) legal protection insurance; and (viii)
    transport insurance.
27. In five of eight affected markets the parties’ combined share is below 25%13, while the
    parties’ combined market share in motor insurance in each of the TPL and non-TPL
    segments is [20-30]%. In the hypothetical segment for overall motor insurance
    (comprising both TPL and non- TPL) the parties’ combined market share would be [20-
    30]%. In workers’ compensation their combined market share is [30-40]% (See Table 1).
11  Market share data for 2005 from the insurance regulator in Luxembourg (Commissariat aux Assurances) are
    not yet available.
12  Market share data for 2005 are not yet final but the data already available from Union professionnelle des
    entreprises d'assurances belges (Assuralia) show that market shares remain largely similar to those of 2004.
13  See Guidelines on the assessment of horizontal mergers under the Council Regulation on the control of
    concentration between undertakings (“Horizontal Guidelines”, OJ C31, 5.2.2004, p5), recital 18. An
    indication that a concentration is not liable to impede effective competition exists when the market share of
    the undertakings concerned does not exceed 25% either in the common market or in a substantial part of it.

28. The present operation gives rise to a modest increase in concentration levels in each of the
     eight horizontal markets.14 The non-life insurance market in Belgium is characterised by
     the presence of several significant competitors such as Fortis, ING, Dexia, KBC and
     Ethias. The market investigation has shown that although special know-how is necessary
     for each insurance product, in general there is high supply-side substitutability and
     therefore, insurers are able to easily switch between the provision of different types of
     insurance.
29. In addition, barriers to entry into the non-life insurance market in Belgium are not
     significant, and the cost of setting up a distribution channel is not a barrier to entry given
     that most non-life insurance products in Belgium are distributed through independent
     brokers. Participants to the market investigation confirmed the high importance of brokers
     in Belgium. Moreover, respondents have pointed out that inter alia legal and regulatory
     constraints and the need for a minimum volume of business might be barriers to entry but
     that these are not important enough to keep new entrants out from the Belgian non-life
14   According to the parties’ estimates, in two of the eight segments, which are (vi) liability insurance (vii) legal
     protection insurance, the post-merger Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index (HHI) in 2004 is below 1000.
     According to the Horizontal Guidelines, recital 19 these markets are unlikely to raise competition concerns
     and do not normally require extensive analysis. In the segments for (i) accident & health insurance, (v)
     insurance against fire and other damage to property and (viii) transport insurance, the post-merger HHI is
     between 1000 and 2000 and the delta below 250 and none of the caveat factors seems to apply (Horizontal
     Guidelines, recital 20). Finally, in the three segments where the parties’ combined markets shares are above
     25%, i.e. (ii) workers’ compensation, (iii) third party liability (“TPL”) motor insurance and (iv) non-TPL
     motor insurance, the post-merger HHI is between 1000 and 2000 and the delta ranges from 320 and 380.

       insurance market. This is in line with previous Commission decisions where the
       Commission considered that the Belgian insurance market is particularly open to entry by
       the major European insurers.15
   30. AXA and Winterthur are also present in the outward insurance distribution market via
       their participation in brokers. In particular Winterthur owns Atelia and has a 60% stake in
       VJL and AXA owns Viaxis. Each of these three companies, however represent less than
       1% of the total insurance broking in Belgium.
   31. In addition, coordinated effects between main non-life insurance providers on the Belgian
       market are very unlikely due to the characteristics of the non-life insurance market in
       Belgium. As mentioned above, concentration levels on the Belgian non-life insurance
       market are low, there are a number of big and small competitors, no constraints on the
       supply side and barriers to entry are not significant. Coordinated behaviour would be also
       difficult to sustain due to the countervailing power of independent brokers, which control
       over 70% of the insurance distribution in Belgium.
   32. The transaction is very unlikely to give rise to any conglomerate effects, and in particular
       portfolio effects, that could lead to a significant impediment of competition. The
       combined AXA and Winterthur product offerings will not be materially different from
       AXA’s current portfolio or a portfolio of any big competitor. The transaction will mainly
       broaden the geographic scope of AXA’s product portfolio by adding the insurance
       business of Winterthur in those countries where AXA is currently not present or has very
       small market shares. Moreover, the parties’ abilities and incentives to profitably bundle
       products will be low. Even if AXA were to become a market leader in all relevant
       markets, there are strong competitors in each market that may counterbalance such efforts
       to bundle or leverage its power to neighbouring markets. The market investigation
       confirmed that there are no capacity constraints on the part of the competitors and entry
       barriers into the Belgian insurance market are low. All the insurance companies are or
       could potentially be active in all the relevant markets where bundling could occur,
       therefore a strategy to bundle could be counteracted by offering a similar bundle of
       insurance products.
   33. It follows from the above that the transaction is unlikely to significantly impede effective
       competition in the non-life insurance sector in general or in any of its segments in
       Belgium.
VI. CONCLUSION
   34. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation and
       to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA Agreement. This
       decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No
       139/2004.
