                                                                    SIMPLIFIED PROCEDURE
                                                                          PUBLIC VERSION
To the notifying party
Dear Madam(s) and/or Sir(s),
Subject:      Case No. COMP/M.3768 – BBVA/BNL
              Notification of 29.03.2005 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No.
                          1
              139/2004
              Publication in the Official Journal of the European Union No. C 84, 06.04.2005,
              page 4
1.   On 29.03.2005, the Commission received notification of a proposed concentration pursuant
     to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 by which Banco Bilbao Vizcaya
     Argentaria S.A. (“BBVA”, Spain) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the
     Council Regulation control of the whole of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro S.p.A. (“BNL”, Italy)
     by way of public bid announced on 29.03.2005.
2.   The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
        -        for BBVA: banking and financial services, mainly in Spain and Latin America;
        -        for BNL: banking and financial services, mainly in Italy.

Commission européenne, B-1049 Bruxelles / Europese Commissie, B-1049 Brussel - Belgium. Telephone: (32-2) 299 11 11.

3. Prior to the public bid, BBVA held control of BNL on the basis of veto rights2, only
   possessing the same level of influence as that normally enjoyed by several jointly-
   controlling shareholders, i.e. the power to block the adoption of strategic decisions.3 With
   the notified transaction, BBVA intends to acquire full sole control over BNL and
   consequently, BBVA will be able to unilaterally impose strategic decisions and to
   determine BNL’s commercial policies. As a result, the notified transaction leads to a change
   in the structure of control of BNL and therefore constitutes a concentration in the meaning
   of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004.4
4. After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
   operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004 and of paragraph
   5, subparagraph c of the Commission Notice on a simplified procedure for treatment of
   certain concentrations under Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/20045.
5. For the reasons set out in the Notice on a simplified procedure, the Commission has decided
   not to oppose the notified operation and to declare it compatible with the common market
   and with the EEA Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of
   Council Regulation (EC) No. 139/2004.
                                                           For the Commission
                                                           (signed)
