Dear Sir or Madam,
1.      On 6 June 2017, the European Commission received notification of a proposed
        concentration pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation by which the undertaking
        BNP Paribas Personal Finance SA (‘BNPP PF’, France), a wholly owned subsidiary of
        BNP Paribas SA, acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation
        sole control of the whole of Commerz Finanz GmbH (‘CFG’, Germany), currently jointly
        controlled by BNPP PF and Commerzbank AG (‘Commerzbank’, Germany), by way of
        purchase of assets.3
2.      The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
        -     CFG: a consumer credits bank, currently jointly owned by BNPP PF and
              Commerzbank, mainly active in the field of loans to individuals in Germany. As part
              of the envisaged transaction, the company will be split between BNPP PF and
              Commerzbank by means of a split-off into two separate and independent business
              units, namely the ‘Point of Sale Finance’ business and the ‘Banking’ business. The
              ‘Point of Sale Finance’ business shall remain with CFG (with BNPP PF as the sole
              shareholder) and will include all activities relating to the distribution of CFG products
              directly to customers or via the point of sale (offline and online) of a retailer.
