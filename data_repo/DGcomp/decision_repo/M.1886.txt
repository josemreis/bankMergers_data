                                                                     To the notifying parties
Dear Sirs,
Subject: Case No COMP. 1886- CGU/NORWICH UNION
             Notification of 15.03.2000 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
             No 4064/89
1.     On 15 March 2000, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
       concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/891 by
       which CGU plc. and Norwich Union plc. agree the terms of a merger of the two
       businesses to create a new group to be called CGNU.
2.     After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the
       notified operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89
       and does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market
       and with the functioning of the EEA Agreement.
I.     THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
3.     CGU provides all classes of insurance and life assurance, in the UK, Continental
       Europe, North America, Asia, Australia and other countries throughout the world.
       CGU also provides other related financial services. The main activities of Norwich
       Union are the provision of general insurance, life insurance, pensions and
       investment products. Norwich Union also provides a number of related financial

     Regulation (EC) No 1310/97, OJ L 180, 9.7.1997, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ L 40, 13.2.1998, p. 17.

     services; it has activities in the UK, Ireland, continental Europe, Canada, Australia
     and New Zealand.
4.   On 21 February 2000 the boards of Norwich Union and CGU announced that they
     had agreed the terms of a merger of the two businesses. Norwich Union’s presently
     issued share capital will be cancelled and re-issued to CGU, which will be re-named
     CGNU. Norwich Union will be therefore become a subsidiary of CGNU. In return,
     CGNU will issue new CGNU ordinary shares to Norwich Union shareholders. CGU
     shareholders will retain their shares.
II. CONCENTRATION
5.   The transaction constitutes an acquisition of sole control by CGU of Norwich Union
     within the meaning of Article 3 of the Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6.   The combined aggregate world-wide turnover of the undertakings concerned
     exceeded 5,000 million EURO in the last financial year (CGU: 28,800 million
     EURO; Norwich Union: 8,400 million EURO). Each of them has a Community-
     wide turnover in excess of ECU 250 million (CGU, EURO […]; and Norwich
     Union, EURO […]), but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate
     Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The notified
     operation therefore has a Community dimension. It does not constitute a co-
     operation case under the EEA Agreement, pursuant to Article 57 of that Agreement.
IV. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
     A. Relevant product markets
7.   Following the practice of the Commission assessing cases in the insurance sector 2,
     there are three major market segments: general insurance, life insurance and
     reinsurance. According to the parties, within the general insurance segment,
     arguably there is a distinct product market for each separate category of risk. The
     parties submit that within the general insurance sector the main risk categories
     should be grouped under two main headings, personal and commercial. Life
     insurance should be subdivided into three categories: life assurance policies,
     investment policies and pensions. Other insurance markets would include marine,
     aviation and goods in transit insurance. Reinsurance includes treaty reinsurance,
     which involves reinsurance of a portfolio of business, covering a number of risks
     and facultative reinsurance, which involves reinsurance on an individual policy
     basis.

    – Aegon/TransAmerica, M.1453 AXA/GRE and others
                                                   2

8.     On the demand side, life and non-life insurance can be divided into as many product
       markets as there are insurances covering different kinds of risk. Their
       characteristics, premiums and purposes are distinct and there is typically no
       substitutability for the consumer between the different risks insured (see for example
       case IV/M.862 - AXA/UAP). The Commission admits3, also, a certain degree of
       supply side substitutability in the insurance sector since certain insurance products
       require a common set of skills and resources including risk management,
       administration I.T. systems and claims management.
9.     However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
       product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
       does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
       competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of
       that area.
       B. Relevant geographic markets
10. The notifying party states that the relevant geographic markets are national (general
       and life insurance), and global (re-insurance, marine, aviation and goods in transit
       insurance). In previous decisions, the Commission has also recognised that the
       market for asset management is a global market4.
11. However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
       geographic markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the
       concentration does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which
       effective competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial
       part of that area.
     C. Competitive assessment
12. The merged entity’s share will not exceed [5-10]% in any product line in France, [5-
       10]% in Spain and [0-5]% in Italy and Belgium. The only Member States in which
       either party has any significant market presence and where there is any significant
       overlap between the parties’ activities are the United Kingdom and Ireland.
     (i) United Kingdom
13. The combined entity will be the largest UK-based composite insurance group, based
       on gross premium and retail investment sales. The new entity will have a market
       share of the UK life insurance sector as a whole of [8-10]%. The transaction will
       create the largest insurer on the UK general insurance sector, with a combined
       market share of [<20]%. By segment of activity the new entity will hold strong
       market shares (above 15%) in the following segments: commercial motor ([…]%),
       commercial liability ([…]%), general liability ([…]%), consequential loss ([…]%),
       fidelity guarantee ([…]%), domestic mortgage indemnity ([…]%) and creditor/loan
       guarantee ([…]%). However, the combined entity will face strong competition
       across all lines from a significant number of competitors well stablished and with

4 see No. IV/M.1453 - AXA/GRE and No. IV/M1.043 - BAT/Zurich
                                                   3

    comparable financial strength such as Royal & Sun Alliance (11.9%), AXA (8.3%),
    Zurich (6.6%) and Allianz Cornhill (4.8%). Furthermore, there are strong
    distribution channels in the UK, creating competitive pressures for insurers.
     (ii)   Ireland
14. The combined entity will also be the biggest insurer in Ireland. The new entity will
    have a market share of the Irish life insurance sector as a whole of 10.8%. CGNU
    will be the largest insurer on the Irish general insurance market, with a combined
    market share of 23.9%. It will be particularly strong in the following segments of
    activity: commercial motor ([28-35]%), commercial property ([28-35]%),
    employer’s liability ([<25]%), public/general liability ([15-20]%), fidelity guarantee
    ([>45]%), creditor/loan guarantee (<20]%), personal motor ([<20]%) and personal
    property ([25-30]%)
15. Fidelity guarantee, that is insurance against loss through behaviour of employees
    such dishonesty, constitutes a sub-segment of pecuniary loss insurance, a small and
    somewhat unusual niche market in Ireland. The parties estimate total gross
    premiums written on this market per annum at around EUR 14 m. [number of
    premiums from which income derives]. Hibernian is the main affiliated company of
    the new group in Ireland. Any market player could offer this service and the
    proposed merger will not materially alter the existing position.
16. There are strong competitors present in all segments of the Irish general insurance
    business including Allianz, AXA, Royal & Sun [Alliance] and Eagle Star (Allied
    Zurich). There are also a number of strong companies, in particular brokers and
    financial institutions, active in the distribution channels on the Irish market.
17. Consequently, the proposed concentration does not create or strengthen a dominant
    position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in
    the EEA or any substantial part of that area.
VI.    CONCLUSION
18. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
    Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
