Dear Sirs,
Subject: Case No IV/M.1331 - ING/BHF
              Notification of 16.10.1998 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation No 4064/89
1.     On 16 October 1998, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
       concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/891 by
       which ING Groep N.V. (ING) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the
       Council Regulation control of BHF-BANK Aktiengesellschaft (BHF).
2.     After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
       operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 and does
       not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and with the
       functioning of the EEA Agreement.
I.     THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
3.     ING is an integrated financial service provider offering a comprehensive range of life
       and non-life insurance, commercial and investment banking, asset management and
       related products mainly in the Netherlands and Belgium, but also world-wide. BHF

     Regulation (EC) No 1310/97, OJ L 180, 9.7.1997, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ L 40, 13.2.1998, p. 17.

     activities comprise corporate banking, asset management, private banking and
     financial market services, mainly in Germany.
4.   ING already holds [… ] in BHF due to recent acquisitions from the public and from
     larger packages.        Further, ING will acquire [less than 5%] from Allianz
     Versicherung-AG and [less than 10%] from Münchener Rückversicherung AG
     increasing its present shareholding to 39.2%.
II. CONCENTRATION
5.   In the light of presence in shareholders meetings (1996 73%, 1997 70% and 1998
     64%), 39.2% will confer ING a majority voting power and hence de facto control
     within the meaning of the Merger Regulation 2. Thus, the transaction constitutes a
     concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6.   The combined aggregate worldwide turnover of the undertakings concerned
     exceeded 5,000 million ECU in the last financial year (ING: 22,882 million ECU;
     BHF: 2,793 million ECU). The aggregate Community-wide turnover of each of them
     was more than 250 million ECU (ING: 12,867 million ECU; BHF: 2411 million
     ECU).
7.   The undertakings concerned do not generate more than two-thirds of their
     aggregated Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State.
     Hence, the concentration has a Community dimension.
IV. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
     A.         Relevant product markets
8.   The notifying party considers, following the practice of the Commission assessing
     cases in the banking sector, three major market segments: retail banking, corporate
     banking and international financial products.
9.   However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
     product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
     does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
     competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that
     area.
     B. Relevant geographic markets
10. The notifying party states that the relevant geographic markets are either national or
     international in scope depending on the sector.
2   See Commission notice on the concept of concentration. OJ C 66 2.3.1998 p.5 par. 14
                                                  2

11. However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
    product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
    does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
    competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of that
    area.
    C. Competitive assessment
12. The merger, seen in perspective, is largely complementary. ING having substantial
    market positions in the Netherlands (18% of the assets of the Dutch banking system,
    17% of its loans and advances and 17% of its deposits) and in Belgium (14% of the
    assets of the Belgian banking system, 20% of its loans and advances and 14% of its
    deposits). However, BHF has a less marked activity in Germany, where it ranks 22nd
    by assets and it has de minimis activity in the Netherlands and no activity in Belgium.
    ING activities in Germany are very reduced (far below 1% of the German financial
    system).
13. While ING is a strong player in insurance in the Netherlands (market shares, life
    24%, non-life 10%) and in Belgium (market shares life 8.1% and non-life 3%), BHF
    has no insurance activities. The new entity will only rank 7th in a ranking of European
    banks by assets. It will not be in the front line of corporate banking and financial
    markets either. However, the European financial sector is becoming more and more
    opened and in many aspects global.
14. In view of the market position of the parties to the concentration, it appears that the
    notified operation will have no or de minimis impact on competition in the EEA.
    Consequently, the proposed concentration does not create or strengthen a dominant
    position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in
    the EEA or any substantial part of that area.
V.  CONCLUSION
15. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
    Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
