                      COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
                                                                 Brussels, 20.01.2006

                                                                      MERGER PROCEDURE
                                                                   ARTICLE 6(1)(b) DECISION
To the notifying party
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:         Case No COMP/M.4047 – AVIVA / ARK LIFE
                 Notification of 08.12.2005 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                 No 139/20041
   1. On 08/12/2005, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
        pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 by which the
        undertaking Hibernian Life Holdings belonging to Aviva plc (“Aviva”, United
        Kingdom) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation
        control of the whole of Ark Life Assurance Company Limited (“Ark Life”, Ireland)
        by way of purchase of shares.
   2. After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the
        operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 and does
        not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and the EEA
        agreement.

Commission européenne, B-1049 Bruxelles / Europese Commissie, B-1049 Brussel - Belgium. Telephone: (32-2) 299 11 11.

I.      THE PARTIES
     3. Aviva, a UK registered company, is involved in the provision of all classes of
        insurance products, as well as savings products and fund management services in
        Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. An Irish subsidiary of Aviva –
        Hibernian Life & Pensions Limited is involved in the underwriting and marketing of
        a range of life insurance products including protection products, pensions and
        savings and investment products. It distributes its products primarily through
        independent brokers with some sales through banks and a direct sales force.
     4. Ark Life is a life insurance company operating in Ireland. It is a wholly owned
        bancassurance subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks (AIB). AIB currently is a tied agent
        of Ark Life, i.e. the only life insurance products sold by AIB are Ark Life products.
II.     THE OPERATION
     5. The notified operation consists of Hibernian Life Holdings, the new entity,
        acquiring the entire issued share capital of Ark Life from AIB pursuant to a Share
        Purchase and Subscription Agreement signed on 22 November 2005. Regarding the
        acquisition of Ark Life, it is proposed that (i) shares will be issued in Hibernian Life
        Holdings and (ii) Aviva on behalf of Hibernian Life Holdings will make a cash
        payment to AIB. On completion, AIB will hold 24.99% of the share capital of
        Hibernian Life Holdings while Aviva will hold the remaining 75.01%.
III.    CONCENTRATION
     6. The operation consists in the acquisition of sole control of Ark Life by Aviva within
        the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the EC Merger Regulation. The shares of
        Hibernian Life Holdings to be issued to AIB do not amount to a controlling interest
        such as to give AIB joint control of Hibernian Life Holdings.
IV.     COMMUNITY DIMENSION
     7. The combined aggregate worldwide turnover of the undertakings concerned is more
        than €5 billion (Aviva € 48.7 billion, Ark Life € 668 million). The aggregate
        Community-wide turnover of each of the undertakings concerned is more than € 250
        million (Aviva € 44.5 billion, Ark Life € 668 million). Whilst Ark Life achieved
        more than two-thirds of its Community-wide turnover in Ireland in 2004, Aviva does
        not achieve more than two-thirds of its Community-wide turnover in one Member
        State. The operation has therefore a Community dimension.
V.      COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
5.1. Relevant markets
Relevant product markets
     8. Aviva’s and Ark Life’s operations encompass the production and distribution of life
        insurance products. In previous decisions, the Commission has distinguished
        between three large categories of insurances: life, non-life insurance and
                                                    2

      reinsurance2. Although the Commission has not definitively concluded on the
      matter, it has suggested that life and non-life insurance can be divided into as many
      product markets as there are different kinds of risks covered, given that their
      characteristics, premiums and purposes are distinct and that there is typically no
      substitutability from the consumer’s perspective between certain different risks
      insured, e.g. life-individual, life-group and unit linked for life insurance; motor, fire,
      transport, health, property, general civil liability, casualty, litigation, working
      accidents etc. for non-life insurance3.
  9. However, the Commission has also recognised that from a supply-side perspective
      the conditions for insurance of different risk types are quite similar and most large
      insurance companies are active in several risk types. This suggests that many
      different types of insurance could be included in the same product market.4
  10. The Parties consider the life insurance market to be the relevant product market.
      However, the Parties note that products in this market can be broadly categorised
      into three categories, namely protection products, pension products and savings and
      investment products.
  11. The market investigation conducted by the Commission appears to support the broad
      segmentation of life insurance market into three product groups: protection products,
      pension products, and savings and investment products. Many respondents pointed
      out that there is a clear distinction between these product groups, each of these
      segments satisfies a particular consumer need and no segment acts as a substitute for
      another. Moreover, some respondents indicated that further segmentation into
      individual and group pension and protection products may be appropriate.
      Distinction between unit-linked and non unit-linked life insurance products did not
      appear to be relevant for the majority of respondents.
  12. As the transaction does not give rise to competition concerns on any of the
      alternative market definitions considered, the exact delineation of the product market
      may be left open.

Relevant geographic markets
    13. According to the Parties there are strong arguments that the affected market is EEA-
        wide. They do not consider that regulatory issues constitute a material barrier to
        international supply in the production of life insurance products. In addition, the
        Parties consider that given the presence of independent brokers, distribution does not
        represent a material barrier to entry. Nor is it likely that branding and reputation
        would be a significant hurdle for an experienced non-national insurer to overcome.
        This would be evidenced by the entry and presence of many non-national firms in
        national markets throughout the Member States of the EU/EEA.
    14. On the other hand, the Commission in its previous decisions has defined the market
        for life insurance as being national in scope as a result of national distribution
        channels, the established market structures, fiscal constraints and differing
        regulatory systems.5
    15. The market investigation appears to sustain the Commission’s earlier findings that
        life insurance market is national in scope. All respondents indicated that this is the
        case, in particular in view of national distribution channels.
    16. However, since the transaction does not give rise to competition concerns on any of
        the alternative market definitions considered, the exact delineation of the geographic
        market may be left open.
5.2. Assessment
    17. In the narrowest possible geographic market, i.e. the Republic of Ireland, the
        transaction combines the third and fourth placed businesses in terms of market share
        competing in the life insurance market with a post merger market share of 19.4%6
        (i.e. Aviva with 10.7% and Ark Life with 8.7%). The first placed firm in terms of
        market share, Irish Life, has a market share of 25% and the second placed firm,
        Bank of Ireland Life/New Ireland, has a market share of 23.9%. There are a number
        of other important competitors, which are mainly owned by large international
        insurance groups.
    18. On the basis of the narrowest hypothetical market definition indicated in the
        Commission's market investigation; i.e. individual protection, group protection,
        personal pensions, group pensions, savings, and investments the new entity would
        not have a 25% post-merger market share in any specific product category market,
        as shown in Table 1.

   19. For all of these specific product categories there remain a number of important
       competitors and the merged entity will generally not become the market leader for
       these specific product categories.
   20. Moreover, according to the parties, the market for the underwriting of life insurance
       products in Ireland is not very concentrated with a pre-merger HHI of 1578, which
       rises by 186 points to 1765 following the proposed merger.
   21. The Commission has also looked at the possible impact of the proposed transaction
       with regard to the distribution of life-insurance products in Ireland given the fact that
       Ark Life uses AIB, the largest Irish commercial bank, as a tied agent. The new
       entity will also enter into an exclusive distribution agreement with AIB for the
       distribution of life insurance products through the AIB retail banking network in
       Ireland. Pursuant to the agreement, AIB will exclusively promote, market and sell
       products of the merged entity to AIB customers.
   22. The exclusive access which the merged entity will have to the AIB distribution
       network does, however, does not foreclose the access of competitors to the market.
       For life insurance products the distribution via independent brokers is the main
       distribution channel bank in the Republic of Ireland, accounting for 60% in 20047.
       The other important channels of distribution are: bank distribution of insurance
       products; tied agents and direct sales. The market investigation conducted by the
       Commission revealed that independent brokers are to remain the most important
       distribution channel in the future. Competitors also did not raise any issues
       concerning the exclusive access of the merged entity to the AIB distribution
       network. Therefore, it is not likely that competition at the distribution level will be
       impeded.
   23. Considering the above, the transaction is not likely to impede effective competition
       in the life insurance sector in general or in any of the life insurance segments in the
       Republic of Ireland.
