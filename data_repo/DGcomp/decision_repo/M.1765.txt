Subject: Case No COMP/M.1765 – KKR ASSOCIATES / SIEMENS NIXDORF
              RETAIL AND BANKING SYSTEMS
              Notification of 16.11.1999 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
              No 4064/89
1.    On 16.11.1999, the Commission received a notification whereby the undertaking KKR
      Associates Ltd (“KKR”), U.S., notified its intention to acquire sole control of the whole
      of the German undertaking Siemens Nixdorf Retail and Banking Systems GmbH
      (“SNRBS”).
2.    After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the notified
      operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/891 and does not
      raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and with the EEA
      Agreement.
I.    THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
3.    KKR is making equity investments on behalf of itself or its investors either through
      controlling ownership or strategic minority positions. The portfolios currently hold by
      KKR comprises investments, inter alia, in manufacture of packages, recreation resorts,
      food retailing, assurance companies. Most of these investments are companies in the U.S..

4.   SNRBS has activities in the retail and banking systems. Retail banking systems include
     the retail workstation business for the retail industry, e.g. Electronic Point Of Sale
     (“EPOS”) systems, Personal Computer (“PC”) -based retail systems. Banking systems
     include the financial workstation business for the banking sector, e.g. automated teller
     machines, automatic teller safes, information/statement printers. A corresponding range of
     hardware and software-related services is offered together with these retail and banking
     systems.
5.   KKR will acquire SNRBS by way of purchase of shares.
II. CONCENTRATION
6.   The transaction consists of the acquisition by KKR of sole control of the whole of
     SNRBS within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
7.   The undertakings KKR and SNRBS have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover in
     excess of EUR 5000 million (In 1998, KKR: […], SNRBS: […]). Each of them has a
     Community-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (KKR: […], SNRBS: […]).
     Only SNRBS achieves more than two-thirds of its aggregate Community-wide turnover
     within one and the same Member States. The notified operation, therefore, has a
     Community dimension according to Article 1(2). It does not constitute a co-operation
     case under the EEA Agreement pursuant to Article 57 of that Agreement.
IV. COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
     Relevant product markets
8.   The notified operation involves the retail and banking systems business including with
     its hardware and software-related services. The notifying party suggests a further
     distinction into financial workstations and retail workstations. The former are typically
     used in self-service cash and non-cash market segments in the banking sector, whereas
     the latter are computerised checkout and cash register systems used in the retail, hotel
     and restaurant business. For the purpose of this case, however, the product market
     definition can be left open, since, even on the basis of the narrowest definition, the
     proposed operation does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the
     common market or a substantial part of it.
     Relevant geographic markets
9.   The notifying party refers to a previous Commission’s decision2, in which the
     geographic scope of the relevant product markets is Community-wide. Since the
     proposed operation has no geographic overlap between the parties in the EU, the
     geographic market definition can be left open.

    Assessment
10. Neither KKR nor any other company owned or controlled by KKR is active in the retail
    and banking systems business. Therefore, the proposed operation would not lead to any
    addition of market shares or vertical relations within the EEA.
    Conclusion
11. In view of the above information, the proposed concentration does not raise serious
    doubts as to its compatibility with the common market and with the functioning of the
    EEA Agreement.
V. CONCLUSION
12. For the above reasons, the Commission decided not to oppose the notified operation and
    to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA Agreement. This
    decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EEC)
    No 4064/89.
