To the notifying party:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:        Case No COMP/M.5347 – Mapfre/ Salvador Caetano / JVs
                Notification of 11/03/2009 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                No 139/2004 1
1. On 11.3.2009, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
      pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 by which the undertakings
      Mapfre S.A ("Mapfre", Spain) and Grupo Salvador Caetano SGPS, S.A. ("Salvador
      Caetano", Portugal), acquire within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Council
      Regulation joint control of the undertakings Choice Car-Comércio de Automóveis, S.A
      ("Choice Car", Portugal), Finlog-Aluguer e Comércio de Automóveis, S.A. ("Finlog",
      Portugal), Guerin-Rent-A-Car (Dois), Lda ("Guerin", Portugal), and Luso Assistência –
      Gestâo de Acidentes, S.A. ("Luso", Portugal), currently owned by Salvador Caetano, by
      way of purchase of shares.
I.      THE PARTIES
2. Mapfre is a holding company of Mapfre Group, which mainly provides insurance products,
      including car insurance worldwide.
3. Salvador Caetano is a parent company of the Salvador Caetano Group, which mainly
      carries out car retail and repair services in Portugal and Spain.
4. Choice Car, Finlog, Guerin and Luso (altogether "the JVs") are wholly owned subsidiaries
      of Salvador Caetano, active in second-hand light car retailing (Choice Car), fleet

    management services (Finlog), short term car rental services (Guerin),2 and services
    ancillary to car accident management (Luso).
II.  THE OPERATION
5. The envisaged operation involves two interdependent transactions: (i) the purchase by
    Mapfre, via its wholly-owned subsidiary Mapfre Autómoviles Sociedad Anonima de
    Segueros y Reaseguros, from Choice Car-SGPS, S.A. (Salvador Caetano) of a 51% stake
    in Finlog; the remaining 49% of shares will be retained by Choice Car-SGPS, S.A.
    (Salvador Caetano) 3 (ii) the purchase by Mapfre and Salvador Caetano, via their jointly
    controlled undertaking Ibericar, Sociedad Ibérica del Automovil, S.A.,4 from Choice Car-
    SGPS, S.A. (Salvador Caetano) of 100% of the share capital of Choice Car, Guerin and
    Luso. 5 As a result of the second transaction, Mapfre will indirectly hold 49% and Salvador
    Caetano 51% of Choice Car, Guerin and Luso's share capital.
III. CONCENTRATION
6. According to contractual arrangements,6 both parties will have joint control over the JVs,
    since (i) both parties will have equal voting rights on the strategic decisions of the business
    policy of Finlog, and (ii) both parties will unanimously decide strategic business decisions
    of Choice Car, Guerin and Luso.
7. Based on the above, the notified operation leads to the acquisition of joint control and
    constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger
    Regulation.
IV. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
8. The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more than
    EUR 5 billion 7 [Mapfre EUR 12,310.5 million, Salvador Caetano EUR 1,293 million].
    Each of them have a Community-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million [Mapfre
    EUR […] million, Salvador Caetano EUR […]million], and they do not achieve more than
    two-thirds of their aggregate Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member
    State. The notified operation therefore has a Community dimension.
2   Via its subsidiary Island Rent, Aluguer de Autómoveis, S.A., Guerin is also active in car rental services and
    children collective car transport services.

V.    COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
1.       Horizontal overlaps
     (1) Relevant product and geographic markets
9. The Commission has found in previous decisions that it may be appropriate to distinguish
    between short-term (e.g. for business and leisure trips) and long-term (e.g. with a rental
    period of more than one year) car rental services8 . It may also be possible to divide the car
    rental market according to customer groups, namely, corporate car rentals and leisure car
    rentals 9 . The Commission has further suggested that there may be a replacement rentals
    segment, in which rental companies settle their accounts with car insurance companies. 10
    With regards to vehicle category, it may also be possible to distinguish between passenger
    cars and industrial vehicles, i.e. trucks 11 .
10. The Commission has also, inter alia, indicated that a market for retail sale of used
    passenger cars and light commercial vehicles could be one of a number of markets related
    to manufacturing and supply of new vehicles. 12
11. In previous cases, the Commission has left open whether the car retailing market is
    national or European-wide in scope, 13 whereas the relevant geographic market for car
    rental may be national in scope. 14
12. However, for the purpose of the proposed transaction it is not necessary to conclude on the
    relevant product and geographic market definitions as irrespective of the precise definition
    the proposed transaction would not lead to competition concerns.
    (2) Competitive assessment
13. The proposed transaction gives rise to the following market situation: (i) Salvador Caetano
    and Guerin will be active in the car rental services market and its possible narrower
    segmentations in Portugal; and (ii) Salvador Caetano and Choice Car will be active in the
    resale of second-hand passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in Portugal and in the
    EEA. However, the proposed transaction would lead to an affected market only in the
    segment of replacement car rentals in Portugal:

       light commercial vehicles
14. The combined market share of Salvador Caetano and Choice Car in the resale of used cars
    in the EEA is significantly below 15%.
15. Although the combined market share in the replacement car rentals segment would be
    higher than 15%, the proposed transaction would not increase the market share of Salvador
    Caetano, as Guerin is currently Salvador Caetano's wholly-owned subsidiary.
16. In light of the above, the Commission considers that the proposed transaction does not give
    rise to competition concerns as regards a possible market for replacement car rentals in
    Portugal.
2.        Vertical Links
17. The proposed transaction would result in minor vertical links between the parties in the
    markets for car insurance and car repair services in Portugal, which could be considered as
    downstream vertically related markets to the markets where the joint ventures are active:
    car rental, full fleet management services, and car retailing.
    (1) Relevant product and geographic markets
18. In previous decisions, the Commission has distinguished between life and non-life
    insurance and indicated that each of them could be subdivided into as many markets as
    there are risks to be covered.15 Therefore, car insurance could be considered as a narrower
    segment of the non-life insurance market. In the past the Commission considered16 that the
    distribution of insurance products is an activity vertically related with the supply of
    insurance products. However, the Commission has always left the market definition for the
    distribution of insurance products open.
15  See e.g. Commission decision in case COMP/M.5075 Vienna Insurance Group/EBV.
16 See e.g. Commission decision in case COMP/M.4284 AXA / Winterthur and case COMP/M.3395 SAMPO
    / IF SKADEFÖRSÄKRING
                                                     4

19. In previous decisions, 17 the Commission has also indicated that car repair and maintenance
    of automotive vehicles can be offered by three categories of operators: dealers of
    automotive vehicles, whether owned by vehicle manufacturers or franchised dealerships
    operating independently; fast fit centres specialised in repair and maintenance of
    automotive vehicles; and independent garages and other full service providers. A narrower
    market of the light repair and maintenance of motor vehicles (i.e. fast fit services) could be
    distinguished from such an overall market.
20. The relevant geographic market for car repair and maintenance, and car insurance may be
    national in scope. 18
21. However, for the purpose of the proposed transaction it is not necessary to conclude on the
    relevant product and geographic market definitions as irrespective of definition the
    proposed transaction would not lead to competition concerns.
    (2) Competitive assessment
22. Mapfre and Salvador Caetano are active in car insurance. In particular, a subsidiary of
    Mapfre, Mapfre Seguros Gerais, is active in the supply of insurance products, whereas a
    subsidiary of Salvador Caetano, Coral – Correctores de Seguros. S.A., distributes car
    insurance products in Portugal. These activities could be considered as vertically related
    to car rental services, full fleet management services, and car retailing services provided by
    the JVs.
23. However the proposed transaction will not lead to any competition concern due to these
    vertical links because regarding car insurance, the market share of Mapfre in the supply
    of car insurance products and of Salvador Caetano in the distribution of car insurance
    products, respectively, are well below 25% (Mapfre [0-5]% and Salvador Caetano [0-
    5]%).
24. In addition, Salvador Caetano is active in car repair and maintenance services market in
    Portugal (excluding fast fit services) that could also be considered as vertically related to
    car rental services, full fleet management services, and car retailing services provided by
    the JVs.
25. Notwithstanding, the proposed transaction will not lead to any competition concern due
    to these vertical links, as in the car repair services market, Salvador Caetano has a
    market share of [0-5]% in the wider car repair services segment, and [0-5]% in the
    narrower segment for car repair services, excluding fast fit services.

VI.    CONCLUSION
26. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation
    and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA Agreement.
    This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No
    139/2004.
