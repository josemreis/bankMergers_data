1.
       On 1.07.2014, the European Commission received notification of a proposed concentration
       pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation by which the undertaking UNIQA
       Previdenza S.p.A. ("UNIQA Previdenza", IT) controlled by UNIQA Insurance Group AG
       ("UNIQA", AT) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation
       control of the whole of the undertaking UNIQA Life S.p.A. ("UNIQA LIFE", IT), currently
       jointly controlled by UNIQA Previdenza and Veneto Banca Holding S.C.p.A., by means of
       amendment of the rules relating to the governance of UNIQA LIFE2.
2.     The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
       - for UNIQA:                    life, non-life and re-insurance services and products
       - for UNIQA LIFE :              life insurance services and products.
3.     After examination of the notification, the European Commission has concluded that the
       notified operation falls within the scope of the Merger Regulation and of paragraph 5(c) and
1         OJ L 24, 29.1.2004, p. 1 ("the Merger Regulation"). With effect from 1 December 2009, the Treaty on the
