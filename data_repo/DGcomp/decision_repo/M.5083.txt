general description.
 To the notifying party:
 Dear Sirs,
 Subject:       Case No COMP/M.5083 – Groupama/ OTP Garancia
                Notification of 10.03.2008. pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
                No 139/20041
 1.    On 10 March 2008, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
       concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 by which
       the undertaking Groupama Int ("Groupama", France) acquires within the meaning of
       Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation control of the whole of the undertaking OTP
       Garancia Biztosító Zártköruen Muködo Részvénytársaság ("OTP Garancia", Hungary)
       by way of purchase of shares.
 2.    After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the operation
       falls within the scope of the Merger Regulation and does not raise serious doubts as to
       its compatibility with the common market and the EEA agreement.
 I.    THE PARTIES
 3.    Groupama is a wholly owned subsidiary of Groupama S.A., which is the parent company
       of an insurance group which provides insurance related services and banking activities.
 4.    OTP Garancia is an insurance company active in life and non-life insurances, mainly in
       Hungary and, to a lesser extent, in Romania.

II.   THE OPERATION
5.    Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding of 11 February 2008 Groupama will
      acquire all shares in OTP Garancia2.
6.    As the proposed transaction would provide Groupama with sole control over OTP
      Garancia, it constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 3 (1) (b) of the
      Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
7.    The transaction has a Community dimension pursuant to Article 1(2) of the Merger
      Regulation. The parties have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover in excess of
      EUR 5,000 million (Groupama EUR 14,165 million, OTP Garancia EUR 316 million)
      and a Community-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (Groupama EUR
      13,977 million, OTP Garancia EUR 316 million). Only OTP Garancia achieved more
      than two thirds of its Community-wide turnover in one Member State (Hungary).
8.    Based on the above, the notified operation constitutes a concentration within the
      meaning of Article 3(1) (b) of the Merger Regulation.
IV. THE RELEVANT MARKETS
         A.      Relevant product markets
9.    The proposed transaction concerns the insurance sector. In previous decisions, the
      Commission has generally distinguished between three large categories of insurance
      services: life insurance, non-life insurance and reinsurance.3
10. Although the Commission has not previously definitively concluded on the matter, it
      has suggested that from the demand side, life and non-life insurance could be divided
      into as many product markets as there are different kinds of risks covered, given that
      their characteristics, premiums and purposes are distinct and that there is typically no
      substitutability from the consumer’s perspective between certain different risks
      insured. However, the Commission has also recognised that from a supply-side
      perspective the conditions for insurance of different types of risk are quite similar and
      most large insurance companies are active in several types of risk.
11. In relation to life insurance the Commission has considered in previous decisions the
      following segmentations: life-individual, life-group and unit linked, or, alternatively,
      individual protection, group protection, personal pension, group pensions, savings and
      investments.4

    Insurance Business 13/12/2007 and Case No COMP/M.4047 Aviva/Arik Life 20/01/2006.

                                                     2

12. In relation to non-life insurance the Commission has previously considered inter alia
    motor, fire, transport, health, property, general civil liability, casualty, litigation,
    working accidents and credit insurance.5 In relation to credit insurance the Commission
    has in the past considered the following sub-segments: delcredere insurance, capital
    goods insurance, consumer credit insurance, fidelity insurance and guarantee
    insurance.6 The precise segmentation of the non-life insurance markets retained in
    different cases has differed slightly from case to case, given in particular the
    classifications made of insurances under national law.
13. Groupama submits that in Hungary the non-life insurance market can be divided into
    motor, fire, transport, health, property, general civil liability, casualty-accident,
    litigation, guarantee/bond, credit, financial losses, assistance and funeral insurance in
    view of regulatory and non-regulatory specificities of the Hungarian market. The
    results of the market investigation conducted by the Commission largely support the
    segmentation of the non-life insurance market put forward by Groupama.7 For the
    purpose of this case the Commission can leave the exact product market definitions
    open as the proposed transaction does not lead to any competitive concerns under any
    alternative market definition.
14. As regards, reinsurance, the Commission has so far left open whether reinsurance
    constitutes a single relevant product market or whether it should be further subdivided
    into life and non-life segments. It has also considered a segmentation according to the
    class of risk covered (e.g. liability, motor, property, etc.).8 For the purpose of this case
    the Commission can leave the exact product market definitions open as the proposed
    transaction does not lead to any competitive concerns under any alternative market
    definition.
      B.        Relevant geographic markets
15. In past decisions, whilst recognising that life and non-life insurance are becoming more
    open to intra-Community competition, the Commission has held that these markets are
    generally national in scope due to national distribution channels, the established market
    structures, fiscal constraints and differing regulatory systems.9 Groupama has not

7  However, a number of respondents indicated that there is no need to further segment the Hungarian
   market for non-life insurance in sub-segments.

    objected to this approach, which was also largely confirmed by the respondents to the
    market investigation.
16. As regards reinsurance, the Commission has previously found that the scope of the
    relevant geographic market is global.10
17. However, for the purpose of this case the Commission can leave the exact geographic
    market definitions open as the proposed transaction does not lead to any competitive
    concerns under any alternative market definition.
V.     COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
18. The proposed transaction does not give rise to any affected market within the EEA
    except for two segments of the non-life insurance markets in Hungary.
19. The combined market share of the parties on the Hungarian overall non-life insurance
    market amounts to [5-15]% (Groupama [0-5]%, OTP Garancia [5-15]%).
20. There are two segments of the Hungarian market for non-life insurance which could
    hypothetically be considered as affected markets: the segment of casualty-accident
    insurance (combined market share of [20-30]%: Groupama [0-5]%, OTP Garancia [20-
    30]%) and fire insurance (combined market share of [15-25]%: Groupama [0-5]%,
    OTP [15-25]%).
21. The parties submit that the two horizontal overlaps are unlikely to raise competition
    concerns considering i) the small size of the market share increments, ii) the fact that
    the combined market shares of the parties do not exceed [20-30]% on either market,
    and iii) the presence on the market of strong and internationally active competitors,
    such as Allianz and Generali Providencia.
22. The increments due to this transaction are small ([0-5]% on the casualty – insurance
    segment; [0-5]% on the fire segment). The market investigation has confirmed that the
    merged entity will experience strong competition from a number of internationally
    active competitors.11 In addition, there are no significant barriers to entry. Recent
    entrants to the Hungarian market for non-life insurance include: AIM General
    Insurance, Genertel Insurance and MKB General Insurance In view of the foregoing,
    the proposed transaction does not significantly impede effective competition in the
    common market or in a substantial part of it.
10 See Case No. COMP/M. 4059 Swiss Re/ GE insurance solutions, 15/03/2006.
11 The main competitors of the parties are on Hungarian market are: Allianz, Generali, K&H and Aegon.

VI. CONCLUSION
23. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1) (b) of Council
    Regulation (EC) No 139/2004.
