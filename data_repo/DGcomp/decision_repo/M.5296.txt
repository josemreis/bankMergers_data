 To the notifying party:
 Dear Sir/Madam,
 Subject:       Case No COMP/M.5296 – Deutsche Bank/ ABN AMRO Assets
                Notification of 28 August 2008 pursuant to Article 4 of Council
                Regulation No 139/2004
 1.   On 28 August 2008, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
      concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/20041 (the
      Merger Regulation) by which the undertaking Deutsche Bank ("DB", Germany)
      acquires sole control of parts of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and parts of ABN AMRO's
      subsidiary IFN Group B.V. (together "ABN AMRO assets", the Netherlands) by way of
      purchase of shares.
 I.   THE PARTIES
 2.   DB is active worldwide in global investment business and provides banking services
      to private clients.
 3.   ABN AMRO Assets include Hollandsche Bank Unie N.V., two of ABN AMRO's
      corporate client departments and 13 of ABN AMRO's commercial advisory centres
      (together "HBU divestment business") as well as ABN AMRO's Dutch factoring
      subsidiary IFN ("IFN divestment business").

 Commission européenne, B-1049 Bruxelles / Europese Commissie, B-1049 Brussel - Belgium. Telephone: (32-2) 299 11 11.

II. THE CONCENTRATION
4.   The proposed transaction consists of the acquisition by DB of sole control of ABN
     AMRO Assets, i.e. the acquisition of all shares of New-HBU II N.V. which will hold
     the HBU divestment business and of all shares of IFN Finance B.V. which will hold
     the IFN divestment business.
5. The acquisition of control by DB over the above mentioned assets constitutes one
     single concentration. Both acquisitions were agreed upon between the same parties
     and on the same date and will also be consummated on the same date. According to
     the SPAs the acquisition of the HBU divestiture business is dependent on the
     acquisition of the IFN divestiture business and vice versa. Consequently, the
     transaction constitutes a single concentration within the meaning of Article 3 of the
     Merger Regulation.2
6. The transaction is a consequence of the acquisition of certain assets of ABN AMRO
     by Fortis, Case COMP/M.4844 - Fortis/ABN AMRO assets which has been
     approved by the European Commission on 3 October 2007 subject to conditions.
     This approval decision is conditional upon the upfront divestiture of the HBU
     divestment business and the IFN divestment business.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
7.   The transaction has a Community dimension pursuant to article 1(2) of the Merger
     Regulation. The parties have a combined aggregate worldwide turnover in excess of
     € 5,000 million (DB: 89,509 million, ABN AMRO assets: […] million) and a
     Community-wide turnover in excess of € 250 million (DB: […] million, ABN
     AMRO assets; […] million). Only ABN AMRO assets realises its entire turnover in
     the Netherlands.
IV. RELEVANT MARKETS
8.   The Parties activities overlap in corporate banking, factoring and financial market
     services in the Netherlands.
9.   In previous decisions3 the Commission has held that banking services can be divided
     into three main segments: (i) retail banking; (ii) corporate banking and (iii) financial
     market services. Also factoring has been distinguished as a separate product market
     within the banking sector.4

                                                       2

     (i) Corporate banking
10. Corporate banking comprises banking services to large corporate customers
    ("LCCs") and smaller commercial clients, these services include notably: domestic
    payments, international payments, savings, loans, documentary credits, export
    financing and cash management services. In previous decisions5 LCCs have been
    considered to be companies with an annual turnover exceeding 250 million,
    commercial customers are companies with a turnover between 2.5 and 250 million.
    Companies with a turnover of less than 2.5 million are normally served through the
    retail banking network.
11. In previous Commission's decisions6 the markets for corporate banking for
    commercial customers have been defined as national while for LCCs the question on
    whether the market for these services is national or wider has been left open.
12. In the Netherlands, DB offers its services mainly to LCC while the HBU divestiture
    business offers its services mainly to commercial clients. DB estimates the Parties
    combined market share to be around [10-20] % in the commercial client segment in
    general and for all possible sub-segments. For LCC the Parties estimate their
    combined market share to be less than [5-10] %. Therefore the proposed transaction
    will not result in affected markets.
     (ii) Factoring
13. Factoring is a financial service by which a commercial client pledges its debtors to a
    factoring company that will collect the money. This financial service has been
    defined by the Commission as a separate relevant product market with a national
    dimension.7
14. The proposed transaction will result in an affected market for factoring.
    (iii) Financial Market Services
15. Financial market services include a broad range of services such as trading in
    securities, bonds, derivatives, foreign exchange and money market instruments. In
    previous decisions8 the Commission has left open the question whether these
    segments constitute separate product markets.

   Case No COMP/M.3894 - Unicredito/HVB, Commission Decision of 18 October 2005.

                                                 3

16. The market has normally been considered wider than national in scope, although in
    some cases an assessment at national basis has been carried out.9
17. Both DB and HBU divestment business have only limited activities in the market for
    financial market services in the Netherlands both in terms of product portfolio and in
    terms of revenue. Their combined activities will not lead to any affected market.
 V. COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
18. The proposed transaction leads to one affected market for factoring in the
    Netherlands.
19. On the market for factoring in the Netherlands the Parties will have a combined
    market share of [20-30] % (IFN divestment business: [20-30] % and DB: [0-5] %).
    However, taking into consideration the small increment ([0-5] %) as well as the
    existing number of significant competitors on the factoring market in the
    Netherlands (ING Commercial – [30-40] %; Fortis – [30-40] %; De Lage
    Landen/Rabobank – [10-20] %) the proposed transaction will not have a significant
    impact on the factoring market in Netherlands.
20. The proposed transaction results in an HHI level post merger of [2000-3000] and a
    delta of only [10-20], which makes it unlikely to identify horizontal competition
    concerns according to the guidelines on horizontal mergers.10
21. Therefore, also based on the Commission's in-depth analysis of the market
    concerned in the case M.4844 - Fortis/ABN AMRO assets, it can be concluded that
    the proposed transaction does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the
    common market.
VI. CONCLUSION
22. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger
    Regulation.
