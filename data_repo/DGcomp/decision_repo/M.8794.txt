Dear Sir or Madam,
1.      On 18 January 2018, the European Commission received notification of a proposed
        concentration pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation by which the undertakings
        Mapfre S.A. (‘Mapfre’, Spain) and Allianz Group (‘Allianz’, Germany), through its
        affiliate Euler Hermes Group SA (‘Euler Hermes’, France), enlarge the scope of the
        activities of their full-function joint venture Solunion Seguros, Compañía Internacional de
        Seguros y Reaseguros, SA (‘Solunion’, Spain), following the transfer of intangible assets
        from Mapfre.3 In light of the circumstances of the case, this gives rise to a concentration
        within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) and Article 3(4) of the Merger Regulation.4
2.      The business activities of the undertakings concerned are:
        <U+F02D>      for Mapfre: an international business group, active in insurance and reinsurance

   internal market and with the EEA Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of
   Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation and Article 57 of the EEA Agreement.
