 Dear Sirs,
 Re. : Case No IV/M.213 - Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank / Midland
           Notification of 23 April 1992 pursuant to Article 4 of
           Council Regulation No 4064/89
 1.      This case concerns the planned acquisition by HSBC Holdings plc
         (HSBC) of Midland Bank plc (Midland) by way of a public bid
         announced on 14 April 1992. HSBC made an offer for the whole of
         the issued share capital of Midland, other than the shares
         already owned, on 8 May 1992.
 2.      After examination of the notification, the Commission has
         concluded that the notified concentration falls within the scope
         of Council Regulation No 4064/89 (the Merger Regulation), and
         does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the
         common market.
 I.      THE PARTIES
 3.      HSBC is an investment company and the ultimate parent company of
         the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Group which is
         active mainly in domestic and international banking and related
         financial services throughout the world but mainly in Asia and
         North America.
 4.      Midland is one of the principal full service banks in the United
         Kingdom. The Midland Group is active in banking, financial and
         related services throughout the world.
 II.     THE CONCENTRATION
 5.      The offer made by HSBC could lead to the acquisition of control
         of Midland within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the Merger
         Regulation.
                                             Rue de la Loi 200 - B-1049 Brussels - Belgium

                                - 2 -
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6.   The concentration has a Community dimension. The combined
     aggregate worldwide turnover of HSBC and Midland in 1991 was more
     than 5,000 million ECU (one-tenth of total assets of HSBC 12,346
     million ECU, of Midland 8,555 million ECU).
     The aggregate Community-wide turnover of each is more than 250
     million ECU (2,062 million ECU for HSBC, 9,814 million ECU for
     Midland).
     The parties do not achieve more than two-thirds of their
     Community-wide turnover in one and the same Member State.
7.   As holding companies both undertakings have interests in
     different economic areas such as banking, insurance, financial
     and other services. Calculation of the geographic breakdown of
     turnover of the various business activities under the Merger
     Regulation requires a split of the assets according to the main
     activities.
8.   Article 5 of the Merger Regulation sets out the rules governing
     the calculation of turnover with a view to determining whether
     or not the operation under scrutiny has a Community dimension
     within the meaning of Article 1. The rule contained in Article
     1(2) aims in particular at measuring the impact of the
     concentration is the Community in order to exclude from the scope
     of the Merger Regulation those concentrations between companies
     which do not have an appreciable commercial activity in more than
     one Member State.
     As a general principle, therefore, the Merger Regulation requires
     that turnover is allocated not by location of the seller of the
     product or service, but by the location of the consumer of the
     product or service. This principle is provided for in Article
     5(1).
9.   For banking activity, applying this principle in the context of
     Article 5(3)(a) requires analysis of lending in terms of location
     of the borrower.
10.  For interbank lending, this means that loans and advances are
     best attributed by location of the borrowing bank branch in order
     to be consistent with the underlying aim of the Merger
     Regulation, even though, in risk assessment, which is at the
     heart of lending decisions, banks take into account the place of
     incorporation of the borrowing bank. The location of the branch
     of the bank to which the loan is made is presumptively the place
     at which the loan will be used. Interbank lending carried out by
     the HSBC and Midland was therefore required to be calculated on
     this basis.
11.  For certain financial services carried out by HSBC and Midland
     (for   example   money   transmission,    stockbroking,   pension
     consultancy) since no lending activity is involved, the principle
     provided for in Article 5(1) has to be used in determining the
     geographical breakdown of these activities.
12.  In order to provide the breakdown required by the Merger
     Regulation, HSBC was required to gather specific data from all
     subsidiaries and branches in every country in which banking
     operations are carried out, and to demonstrate how the data
     reconcile to the audited published accounts. This data has been
     carefully checked by the Commission.

IV. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
13. HSBC is based in the Far East. In 1990 it changed its legal
    domicile becoming an UK non-resident corporation for tax
    purposes. Following a merger with Midland the HSBC would become
    a fully-fledged UK bank.
    The HSBC Group ranks as the world 23rd largest bank by
    shareholders' funds and 25th by assets. It is active mainly in
    Hong Kong, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Its presence in Europe
    is relatively less significant representing around 18 % of its
    total assets.
    Midland carries out its activities mainly in the UK. Midland is
    also present in the other main world financial centres. Midland
    group is the world 50th largest bank by shareholders' funds and
    the 40th by assets. Within the EC, Midland is currently the 19th
    largest bank.
    The combined group would be the world 11th largest and EC 5th
    largest bank by shareholders' funds1. 50 % of the combined assets
    and deposits of the group would be located in Europe.
14. In overall terms, the two undertakings are geographically
    complementary. There is no appreciable overlap in any Member
    State in 15 separate sectors analysed in the notification, these
    sectors grouping commercial activity of a similar type2. The UK
    is the only Member State where both Midland and HSBC carry out
    significant business. Even in the UK, the actual or potential
    reduction in competition in these sectors following the merger
    would have no appreciable adverse impact on competition.
15. The only relevant product market identified as affected by the
    proposed concentration is that of Gilt-edged stock market-making3
    in the UK, where Midland's subsidiary Greenwell Montagu Gilt
    Edged and HSBC's subsidiary James Capel Gilts Ltd are both market
    makers.
16. In this market, the Bank of England issues securities on behalf
    of the UK government. Only registered gilt-edged market makers
    (GEMMs) may purchase the stock from the Bank of England and deal
    with it subsequently. The GEMMs' customers are principally
    institutional investors such as banks, pension funds, and
    investment houses. The market is regulated and monitored by the
    Bank of England.
17. The market has operated in its present form since 1986. At the
    outset, the Bank of England accepted 27 GEMMs, 11 of which
    subsequently withdrew. There have been 3 new entrants, the latest
    of which, Deutsche Bank Gilts, joined in April 1992. Since 1990,
    the GEMMs overall have traded profitably. The Bank of England,
    and the customers contacted consider that there is strong
    competition between the GEMMs. Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged is
1   After Credit Agricole, Barclays, National Westminster and
    Deutsche Bank.
2   The sectors identified are : retail deposits, retail lending,
    retail other banking, including credit and debit cards and
    travellers'   cheques,   corporate    banking,   trade   finance,
    correspondent banking, treasury dealing, merchant banking,
    leasing, securities dealing, investment management, pension
    services, trustee services, insurance broking, and insurance
    underwriting.
3   Gilt-edged means UK government, or UK government-guaranteed
    stocks denominated in sterling. The market is a means of
    financing the UK public sector deficit.

                                - 4 -
     among the top six GEMMs which together accounted for 63 % of
     retail turnover in 1991. James Capel Gilts is among the bottom
     six GEMMs which together accounted for 12 % of the market in
     1991. The combination of Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged and James
     Capel Gilts will have no material impact on competition in this
     market. This is confirmed by the Bank of England and the
     customers contacted.
V.   OVERALL CONCLUSION
18.  It follows from the above that the proposed acquisition would not
     create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which
     competition would be significantly impeded in the common market
     or a substantial part thereof.

                                  *
     For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose
     the notified concentration and to declare it compatible with the
     common market. This decision is adopted in application of Article
     6(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation No 4064/89.
