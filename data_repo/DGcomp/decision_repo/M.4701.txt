To the notifying party
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject:       Case No COMP/M.4701 - Generali/PPF Insurance Business
               Notification of 25.10.2007 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
               No 139/20041
1. On 25 October 2007, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration
    pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 ("the Merger Regulation")
    by which the undertaking Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. ("Generali", Italy) acquires
    within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of the Council Regulation control of the whole of
    the insurance business in Central Europe to Central Asia of PPF Group N.V. ("PPF", the
    Netherlands) by way of purchase of shares in a newly created company, Generali PPF
    Holding B.V. ("Newco", the Netherlands).
2. After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the operation
    falls within the scope of the Merger Regulation and does not raise serious doubts as to its
    compatibility with the common market and the EEA agreement.
I.    THE PARTIES
3. Generali is the parent company of an international group of companies active in the insurance
    and financial sector worldwide. Generali is primarily active in Italy but the group is also
    present in other EU countries (e.g. Germany, France, Austria and Spain). Recently, Generali
    group has opened offices in the main Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries.
4. PPF is the principal holding company of a financial group originated in the Czech
    Republic. PPF is now active in Central Europe, Central Asia, China and Vietnam. The
    group specialises in financial services for retail clients in insurance and consumer
    financing. PPF's insurance business is primarily carried out via the Czech ex-monopolist
    insurer Ceská pojištovna ("CP", Czech Republic). CP is active in the Czech Republic,
    Slovakia, Russia, Cyprus and Ukraine.

II.   THE OPERATION
5. The operation concerns the acquisition of shares by Generali and PPF in a newly created
    company, Newco. Generali and PPF will contribute to Newco the following businesses (i)
    Generali's relevant insurance business operating in an area from Central Europe to Central
    Asia ("CECA"); and (ii) PPF's insurance and insurance-related business in CECA including
    CP (the "PPF Insurance Business").
III. CONCENTRATION
6. Pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement and Shareholders Agreement entered into by
    Generali and PPF on 10 July 2007, Generali will acquire 51% of Newco and PPF the
    remaining 49%.
7. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, each of Generali and PPF will be entitled to
    nominate [an equal number] of the members of the Board of Directors. Decisions taken by the
    Board of Directors of Newco will require simple majority, including the business plan and the
    annual budget. Therefore, Generali and PPF would be able to veto these strategic decisions.
    However, the Shareholders Agreement establishes a resolution mechanism when deadlock
    situations occur. This mechanism will allow Generali to unilaterally pass on resolutions at the
    General Shareholders meeting within [less than 3 months]2. This time period does not seem to
    be unusually lengthy, in particular when considering that strategic decisions such as the
    business plan and the annual budget are adopted once per year.
8. It should also be noted that Generali's Head Office will according to the Shareholders
    Agreement be entitled to set risk and investment methodology and guidelines and group
    wide limits, which will (in the context of the insurance sector) have a considerable effect
    on both the commercial policy to be adopted by Newco as well as on its financial results.
9. PPF can nonetheless veto certain decisions for which the affirmative vote of […] members
    of the Board nominated by Generali and […] members nominated by PFF is required
    ("qualified decisions"). In case of a deadlock situation, the matter is referred to the
    General Shareholders' meeting where the affirmative vote of shareholders representing
    [more than 51%] of Newco shares is required. Most of these "qualified decisions" concern
    issues (such as, inter alia, the amendment or modification of the constitutive documents;
    investments by Newco or companies controlled by Newco in other companies, changes in
    Newco’s share capital, including increase or reduction of capital) which are normally
    accorded to minority shareholders in order to protect their financial interests as investors in a
    joint venture. However, among the “qualified decisions” (i.e. decisions which can be vetoed
    by PPF), the Shareholders Agreement includes decisions concerning the appointment and
    dismissal of the CEO of Newco and its subsidiaries. Veto rights on the appointment of senior
    management of an undertaking are normally considered to be one of the elements which
    could confer upon the holder the power to exercise decisive influence on the commercial
    policy of such undertaking.
10. However, in the present case, such limited veto right does not appear to confer control
    upon PPF in view of the other decisions which could be adopted unilaterally by Generali.
    In addition, if PPF exercises its veto right on the appointment of senior management at the
    General Shareholders' meeting, Generali would be able to exercise a call option over
2 […]
                                                     2

    PPF's entire shareholding in Newco. […], the incentives of PPF to actually exercise the
    veto rights at the General Shareholders' meeting seem to be rather low.
11. As important strategic decisions relating to the commercial policy of Newco can be
    determined unilaterally by Generali and PPF's incentives to use the limited veto rights seem
    low, the Commission has concluded that Newco will be solely controlled by Generali.
12. Therefore, the transaction leads to an acquisition of sole control by Generali over PPF
    Insurance Business and constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of
    the Merger Regulation.
IV. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
13. The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more than
    EUR 5 billion3 (Generali € 64,526 million, PPF Insurance Business € 1,403 million). Each
    of them have a Community-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (Generali € 59,721
    million, PPF Insurance Business € […]). Only PPF Insurance Business achieves more
    than two thirds of its Community-wide turnover in one Member State (the Czech
    Republic). The notified operation therefore has a Community dimension.
V.    COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
      (1)      RELEVANT MARKETS
14. The transaction concerns insurance products as well as asset management and assistance
    services.
    A.1. Insurance products
      a) Relevant product markets
15. Generali puts forward that in its previous decisions, the Commission has distinguished
    between three large categories of insurance services: life insurance, non-life insurance and
    reinsurance4. Although the Commission has not definitively concluded on the matter, it
    has suggested that life and non-life insurance can be divided into as many product markets
    as there are different kinds of risks covered, given that their characteristics, premiums and
    purposes are distinct and that there is typically no substitutability from the consumer’s
    perspective between different risks insured.5
16. The results from the market investigation have shown that the insurance companies active
    on the Czech market strictly distinguish between life and non-life insurance and
    reinsurance. A substantial number of them specialise only in one of these sectors and
    some are even active solely in one sector (mainly in non-life insurance). In addition, the
    life and non-life insurance and reinsurance products are not substitutable for each other at
    the level of demand while supply side substitution seems more limited than between
    different segments within those areas. In addition, life and non-life insurance markets in
3   Turnover calculated in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Merger Regulation and the Commission Notice
    on the calculation of turnover (OJ C66, 2.3.1998, p25).

                                                           3

    the Czech Republic have to some extent different characteristics (e.g. as regards the
    dynamics of the market, the identity of competitors, distribution channels etc.6).
17. On the basis of the foregoing the Commission considers that life insurance, non-life
    insurance and reinsurance form separate product markets. Since the reinsurance market is
    not affected by the present transaction, the following analysis focuses on a possible
    further segmentation of life insurance and non-life insurance markets.
18. Generali considers that the Czech life insurance sector should be divided into the
    following product markets: (i) life risk protection products (i.e. policies covering stand-
    alone life risks) (Life Risk Products); (ii) savings and investment products, which
    comprise both endowment policies as well as unit-linked insurance policies (Savings and
    Investment Products); and (iii) supplementary pension insurance (Supplementary Pension
    Products). This segmentation follows past decisions where the Commission differentiated
    between protection products, saving and investment products and pension products7.
19. Generali considers that the other possible segmentations previously identified by the
    Commission (i.e. group life policies v individual life policies and unit-linked and non
    unit-linked policies8) are not appropriate as far as the Czech market is concerned.
20. The market investigation conducted by the Commission appears to support the broad
    segmentation of life insurance market into three product groups: life risk protection
    products, savings and investment products, and supplementary pension products. Many
    respondents pointed out that there is a clear distinction between these product groups and
    that they form separate product markets9. With respect to a possible further differentiation
    of group and individual policies as well as unit-linked and non unit-linked policies, the
    results of the market investigation were more mixed. Some respondents indicated that
    further segmentation into unit-linked and unit-linked life policies may be appropriate in
    the Czech Republic10. On the other hand, the distinction between individual and group life
    insurance products did not appear to be relevant in the present case for the majority of
    respondents11.
21. However, as the transaction does not give rise to competition concerns under any of the
    alternative market definitions considered, it can be left open whether distinct product
    markets based on the above described life insurance segments or sub-segments exist.
22. For the non-life insurance sector, Generali submits that there are 18 regulatory classes
    under Czech law which are grouped under 7 broader categories. Generali argues that these
    7 broader categories correspond to the classification adopted by the Commission in
    previous decisions. Therefore, Generali considers that the non-life insurance sector should
    be divided into the following product markets: (i) accident and sickness; (ii) motor
    vehicle; (iii) property; (iv) marine, aviation and transport (MAT); (v) liability; (vi) credit
    and suretyship and (vii) travel.

23. The results from the market investigation seem to be confirming this segmentation of the
    non-life insurance sector12. Although a number of insurance companies active on the
    Czech market offer the whole range of non-life insurance products, there are also
    companies specialising only in some of the seven segments.
24. The insurance companies distinguish between products from different segments, even
    though some of them indicated that, although from the perspective of the end customers
    the products belonging to different segments of non-life insurance are not substitutable for
    each other, there is still certain substitutability from the supply side perspective – on the
    wholesale level. It is mainly due to the role of intermediaries who distribute the whole
    range of products to the end customers. On the other hand, certain respondents in the
    market investigation indicated that some segments could possibly be further sub-divided.
    Several respondents indicated that motor vehicle insurance could be further subdivided
    into Casco insurance and motor third party liability (MTPL) insurance. While MTPL
    insurance is obligatory for each motor vehicle, the penetration of Casco insurance in the
    Czech Republic is much lower. Further, the Commission has in the past distinguished
    within credit and suretyship insurance the following possible sub-segments (i) delcredere
    insurance, (ii) capital goods insurance, (iii) consumer credit insurance, (iv) fidelity
    insurance and (v) guarantee insurance13.
25. However, for the purpose of this case, it is not necessary to decide whether distinct
    product markets based on the above described non-life insurance segments or sub-
    segments exist as the transaction does not give rise to competition concerns under any of
    the alternative market definitions considered.
      b) Relevant geographic markets
26. The Commission in its previous decisions has defined the markets for life and non-life
    insurance as being mainly national in scope as a result of national distribution channels,
    the established market structures, fiscal constraints and differing regulatory systems14. For
    the purpose of this notification, Generali has considered life and non-life insurance
    markets on a national basis, except for MAT insurance, that Generali has considered at
    least EEA-wide in scope, in line with findings of the Commission in previous cases15.
27. According to the results of the market investigation, the insurance companies active on
    the Czech market usually sell their products exclusively on this market and only a small
    number of them offer their products – to a limited extent and usually under different
    conditions – also on the Slovak market. Further, the regulatory framework is national in
    scope and the importance of cross-border sales by insurance providers from other EU
    countries under the freedom to provide services is negligible16 (except for MAT insurance
    discussed below). On this basis and in line with its previous practice the Commission
    considers that – except for MAT insurance – the Czech insurance market is regarded as
    national in scope.
12  See replies to question 11 of the questionnaire to competitors, question 10 of the questionnaire to
    intermediaries and question 9 in questionnaire to customers.
13  See Case No COMP/M.3786 BP/Euler Hermes/Cosec, 29/03/2006 and Case No COMP/M.2602
    Gerling/NCM, 11/12/2001.

    Assicurazioni/Lloyd Italico, 15/03/2001.
15  See Case No COMP/M.4284 AXA/Winterthur, 28/08/2006.
16  According to the CNB Financial Market Supervision Report 2006, page 75, these providers represented
    only 1% of the total premiums written in 2005. Even though their activities have a growing trend in
    particular in non-life insurance, their overall importance is still insignificant.
                                                             5

28. The market investigation conducted by the Commission largely supports the suggestion
    that the market for MAT insurance, as a whole, is at least EEA-wide. A large majority of
    respondents confirmed this definition of the geographic market. However, as the
    transaction does not give rise to competition concerns under either national or an EEA-
    wide market definition, the exact delineation of the product market may be left open.
    A.2. Assistance services
29. According to Generali, assistance services differ from insurance services to the extent that
    the assistance provider will organise the assistance to the policyholder (such as sending an
    ambulance or a car recovery vehicle, organising the repatriation of the policyholder or
    contacting travel agents, airlines and hotels to make the necessary changes to a trip, etc)
    whereas the insurer covers the costs related to such unexpected events. Assistance
    products can cover a very wide range of different services.
30. In this case, in line with previous Commission decisions, travel assistance17 and road
    assistance18 can be identified, with a geographic market national in scope. Even though
    many respondents in the market investigation noted that assistance services are usually
    not provided to the final customers separately but in most cases within the framework of
    motor or travel insurance, the investigation in principle supported this market definition19.
    A.3. Asset management
31. The Commission has previously defined asset management as a relevant product market
    and concluded that it is distinct from life and non-life insurance. It includes the creation,
    establishment and marketing of retailed pooled funds (mutual funds, unit trusts,
    investment trusts and open-ended investment companies), and the provision of portfolio
    management services.20 Generali considers, in accordance with Commission precedents,
    that the market for asset management services is global in scope given that there is a need
    to pool risks on an international basis.21 However, the exact market definition can be left
    open as the transaction would not lead to competition concerns under any alternative
    definition.
      (2)      COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT
32. The proposed concentration gives rise to a number of horizontally affected markets in the
    life and non-life insurance sectors in the Czech Republic. Assistance services for road and
    travel insurance are vertically affected markets.
33. In 2006 life insurance represented 39% of the total Czech insurance market (measured by
    written premiums), the non-life insurance market represented 61%. The life insurance
    share in the total insurance market is increasing yearly.
17  See Case IV/M. 862 AXA/UAP 20/12/1996 where the Commission identified travel assistance as a relevant
    product market.
18  See Case COMP/M.3772 Aviva/RAC, 03/03/2006, in which the Commission identified roadside assistance
    as a relevant product market. See also Case No COMP/M.3517 CVC/Permira/AA, 27/08/2004, in which the
    Commission identified breakdown, road assistance and related services as a same market.

    questionnaire to customers.

 34. As stated above (paragraph 4), the PPF Insurance Business in the Czech Republic is
     carried out by CP which is the legal successor of Ceska statni pojistovna, the former state-
     owned insurance company which ran the insurance monopoly until 1991. According to
     Generali, CP does not have currently any particular advantage from its status as a former
     state monopoly. This was also confirmed by the national regulator, the Czech National
     Bank (CNB). As shown in the table below, its market share has been decreasing due to the
     entry of well established international insurance companies such as Allianz, ING, KBC
     (controlling CSOB financial group), Generali, AXA or Wiener Staedtische (controlling
     Kooperativa insurance company).

 35. PPF will contribute all its insurance and insurance-related business (asset management) in
     CECA to Newco. Generali and the PPF Insurance Business overlap in the following
     sectors: (i) insurance sector in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and (ii) asset
     management in the EEA. Additionally, Generali is present in the life and non-life
     insurance markets in the following CEE countries which are part of the EU: Bulgaria,
     Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovenia. However, the PPF Insurance Business has no
     presence in these countries. The proposed transaction will only lead to affected markets in
     the Czech Republic.
 36. The PPF Insurance Business is active in asset management in the Czech Republic via its
     subsidiary CP Invest (national market share [0-5%]), Generali is not active in this market
     in the Czech Republic. On an EEA-wide level the Parties estimate their combined market
     share to be less than [1%].
 37. In the Slovak Republic the horizontal overlap of the PPF Insurance Business and Generali
     in the insurance sector will not lead to affected markets nor will the proposed transaction
     lead to vertically affected markets. Their combined market shares amount to [5-10%] and
     [10-15%] for life and non-life insurance sector respectively.
 38. The PPF Insurance Business is not active in reinsurance and neither Generali nor the PPF
     Insurance Business distributes third party insurance products.
       B.1 Life insurance – Czech Republic
       Overview of the Czech life insurance sector
 39. In general the low Czech market penetration rate, defined as a ratio of written premiums
     compared to the GDP, of 1.5% for life insurance could suggest that significant growth
     could be expected in this sector which will be an incentive for other insurers to start
     operating on the Czech market. The average EU-25 market penetration rate for life
     insurance is 5.1%. 42% of the competitors participating in the market investigation stated
     that the market penetration rate in the life insurance sector is low while 58% quantified
     the penetration rate as medium. All competitors forecasted a growth in written premium
     for the next three years in the life insurance sector.

40. In 2006 the parties combined market share for the overall life insurance sector was 32%
    (CP: 28% - Generali: 4%). Within the life insurance sector, the proposed operation gives
    rise to two affected markets in the Czech Republic: savings and investment products and
    supplementary pension products. An overview of the parties' and competitors' market
    shares in the life insurance segments is provided in the table below.

        (i) Savings and investment products
41. In savings and investment products, the market investigation confirmed that the proposed
    operation does not significantly impede effective competition in the Czech Republic. It
    should be noted that Generali's market share increased by [0-5%] in the last three years
    but CP's market share dropped by [5-10%] in the same period. Generali's main
    competitors in this market are strong international players including ING, CSOB (which
    belongs to the KBC group) and Kooperativa (controlled by Wiener Staedtische
    Allgemeine Versicherung AG). In addition there are other international companies active
    on the Czech insurance market which could start competing on life insurance products and
    insurance companies could become active on the Czech market via the European principle
    which allows companies the freedom to provide services in other Member States.
42. Furthermore, based on the above table, the HHI of this market pre-transaction is […],
    post-transaction it would be […] i.e. an increment of […] which is below the 250 save
    harbour provided by the Horizontal Merger Guidelines22.
43. In case this market should be further subdivided into unit-linked and non-unit-linked
    products, as indicated by the market investigation, the market share of the merged entity
    would be below 15% for unit-linked products and [35-40%] (CP [35-40%], Generali [0-
    5%]) for non unit-linked products. Therefore, the transaction does not significantly
    impede competition even under the narrower market definition.

    (ii) Supplementary pension products
44. The market investigation also confirmed that the proposed operation does not significantly
    impede effective competition in the supplementary pensions market in the Czech
    Republic. The parties combined market share is [20-25%] while its closest competitor
    AXA has a market share of [20-25%] and four competitors' market shares range around
    [10-15%]. As is the case for savings and investment products, international companies are
    active on this market or could easily become active.
45. Based on the above table, the HHI levels both pre- and post-transaction are below 2000
    and the increment arising from the transaction is only […] points i.e. well below the
    threshold specified in the Commission's Horizontal Merger Guidelines.
46. Further, the market investigation indicated that the barriers to entry into the Czech life
    insurance market are low and that recently companies such as Direct pojistovna,
    Dolnorakouska, AEGON, AXA and AIG started operating on the Czech life insurance
    market. It should be noted that legislation concerning pension reform will be prepared in
    2008-2009, however, at this moment in time the influence on the life insurance sector can
    not be quantified.
47. In the light of the foregoing, the present transaction does not raise any competition
    concerns on the life insurance market in the Czech Republic or any segment thereof.
      B.2. Non life insurance – Czech Republic
      Overview of the Czech non-life insurance sector
48. The Czech non-life insurance market is the second largest market within the CEE region,
    behind the Polish non-life insurance market. The CNB Financial Market Supervision
    Report 2006 (the "CNB report") indicates that non-life insurance represented 61.3% of the
    total Czech insurance sector in 2006.23
49. Generali argues in the notification that on average the levels of growth in the Czech non-
    life insurance markets have been modest in comparison with other EU Member States in
    recent years. However, Generali indicates that the low level of insurance penetration in
    the Czech market would allow for a substantial potential for expansion and development
    of competition in this country. Generali therefore expects significant growth in this area
    going forward.
50. Total insurance penetration amounted in 2005 to 3.9% in the Czech Republic while the
    average EU-25 penetration ratio amounted to 8.5 %24. According to the European
    Commission's Interim Report on the business insurance sector inquiry" of January 2007 the
    main factor influencing market entry by insurers is potential for growth, which seems to be
    present in the Czech market.25
51. Competitors and intermediaries' replies to the market investigation show that the
    penetration level is perceived to be medium and the expected growth ranges between 3 to
    5%.26 The CNB report indicates that premiums written in non-life insurance in 2006

    intermediaries.

    showed lower growth than in 2005 (3.8% v. 5.5%) but the CNB considers that this is due
    to "high competition in the Czech insurance market, which is pushing down premium
    rates, and also to insurance contracts […] concluded with insurance undertakings from
    other EU or EEA countries operating in the Czech Republic under the freedom to provide
    services".27 The reply from the Czech regulator CNB indicates that in the first half of
    2007 the premiums written in non-life insurance grew by 4.6% which seems to indicate
    certain improvement of the growth dynamics compared to the previous years28. Therefore,
    despite a certain decrease of the dynamic growth of the non-life insurance market in the
    Czech Republic in the recent years, this market is still expected to grow in the future and
    provide attractive opportunities for existing suppliers or new entrants.
52. The market investigation has further addressed whether there are any capacity constraints
    to expansion in the non-life insurance market in the Czech Republic29. The majority of the
    respondents (competitors and intermediaries) agree with Generali that there are no such
    constraints.
53. Generali entered the non-life insurance sector in the Czech Republic in 1993. Since then,
    Generali's market share in the overall non-life insurance sector has remained rather
    modest (mostly below 5%). In 2006, Generali's market share was 6.1%. As the former
    monopolist, CP's market shares are considerably higher (36.6% in the overall non-life
    insurance sector). However, Generali has provided information on the evolution of CP's
    market shares since 1998. One can see clear trend of a decrease of CP's market share:
    from 61.7% in 1998 to 36.6% in 200630. Other significant competitors in the overall non-
    life insurance market are Kooperativa (including its subsidiary Ceská podnikatelská
    pojištovna – CPP) with 33.5% market share, Allianz with 9.9% and CSOB with 4.5% and
    a number of other smaller insurance companies covering the remaining almost 10% of the
    market. The market shares of CP, Generali and their competitors in the main segments of
    the non-life insurance market are summarised in the following table.

   54. The notifying party further argues with respect to Generali's position in the non-life
        markets that it is not a strong competitive force or a particular innovator. The market
        investigation also did not provide any indications that Generali could be considered as a
        maverick which would represent an important competitive force on the Czech non-life
        insurance market eliminated by the merger.
   55. A review of Generali's internal documents drafted for the purposes of the present
        transaction and disclosed to the Commission shows optimistic, realistic and pessimistic
        scenarios for CP and Generali non-life business in the Czech Republic. According to the
        scenario, Generali market share would either decrease (pessimistic), remain stable at
        around […] (optimistic), or slightly increase by […] (optimistic) As regards CP's market
        share, even on the optimistic scenario, the document forecasts a decrease to [less than
        35%].31
   56. The results of the market investigation indicate that Generali is considered as one of their
        top 5 competitors in the non-life insurance only by half of the respondents. Nearly all
        intermediaries, however, included Generali among the top 5 insurers in non-life32. The
        CNB report also includes Generali among the group of large insurance undertakings (life
        and non-life) considering that its market share exceeded 5% in 2006.33
   57. As for the parties' competitors in the non-life insurance market, the CNB report and the
        market investigation show that large and medium-sized insurance undertakings belong to
        major international insurance and financial groups, confirming Generali's views.
        Examples are Kooperativa (controlled by the Austrian insurer Wiener Staedtische),
        Allianz, CSBO (owned by the Belgian bank KBC), Uniqa (non-life Austrian insurer) and
        American International Group (AIG). The market investigation has further confirmed the

        valuations of CZIH and Generali CEE", 13 April 2007.

    presence of recent entrants into the non-life markets including Direct, Triglav and
    Wüstenrot and a few respondents quote AXA and ACE as insurers expected to enter the
    market34. The CNB report indicates that the number of branches in the Czech Republic of
    insurance undertakings from EU and third countries rose in the area of non-life insurance
    between 2004 and 2006 from 6 to 1335. In addition, a number of existing insurance
    companies indicated that they plan to further expand their operations in the non-life
    insurance market in the Czech Republic36. Therefore, the merged entity would face even
    after the merger significant actual competitors as well as potential new entrants which
    would be able to provide significant competitive constraints on the merged entity.
58. Generali has also noted the activity of insurers outside the Czech Republic that provide
    insurance services under the freedom to provide services ("FOS providers"). Generali
    argues that the role of these FOS providers, although not significant currently, is
    increasing and already creates competitive pressure on Czech insurers. The replies to the
    market investigation generally show however that competitors view penetration of FOS
    providers as low (without distinguishing between life and non-life). Some replies further
    argue that it has not been as high as expected or that their impact on business is in any
    event insignificant. Replies from intermediaries are more balanced with some respondents
    considering that penetration of FOS providers is low whereas others consider that it will
    grow or increases competition. Finally, customers' replies frequently refer to FOS
    providers on support of easy access to the Czech insurance market37.
59. As regards the regulator's views, the CNB indicates that FOS providers accounted for 1%
    of the total premiums written by domestic insurance companies in 2005 (for both life and
    non-life but mostly attributable to non-life). CNB expects that 2006 figures will show an
    increase "in the scope and importance of this form of service provision". Moreover, the
    CNB provides some figures on EU or EEA companies intending to carry on insurance
    business in this Member State under the freedom to provide services: 401 by the end of
    2006 which represents an increase in 73 companies compared to the end of 200538. CNB
    in its reply indicates that the number of these companies has grown further this year
    exceeding already 45039. Therefore, even though FOS providers do not play an important
    role on the overall non-life insurance market, they are able to offer alternative products in
    non-life insurance (in particular through independent channels such as brokers) in case the
    offer of the established providers is limited. In addition, the dynamic growth of FOS
    providers interested in the Czech insurance market confirms the attractiveness of the
    market for new entrants.
60. As regards barriers to entry in the Czech insurance market, Generali argues that there are
    no material barriers to entry in non-life insurance markets in the Czech Republic.
    According to Generali, brand loyalty is not a decisive factor in the insurance market, costs
    of entry are low and there are no IP-related issues. Regarding the results of the market
    investigation, the presence of a distribution network is perceived by competitors as the
    major barrier to entry. Intermediaries however do not consider it relevant. Other factors
    hindering entry are branding and reputation, as well as customer inertia. Regulation

    however is not considered a barrier40. Overall, as documented by the growing number of
    foreign insurance companies entering the Czech market (either by setting up a branch or
    as a FOS provider) in the recent years (see paragraphs 57-59 above), the existing entry
    barriers seem to be rather limited and do not hinder new entry in any significant way.
61. Distribution of non-life insurance products in the Czech Republic is done, according to
    the notifying party, largely via non-exclusive insurance intermediaries (brokers and to a
    lesser extent multilevel market agents - MLM41, dealers, independent agents etc.) which
    together represent [55-60%] of the new premiums in the overall Czech non-life market in
    2006. In particular, independent brokers play a very important role in the non-life
    insurance distribution as they represent according to the parties' estimates almost [50-
    55%] of the new premiums. This is also valid for most of the individual segments of non-
    life insurance (with the exception of accident and sickness insurance and credit and
    suretyship insurance where exclusive agents and direct sales respectively are the main
    distribution channel). The importance of large independent brokers (such as AON Stach,
    Marsch, WILLIS, Greco, Renomia, Respect or CAC) was also largely confirmed by the
    market investigation42. Brokers (as well as other independent distribution channels) thus
    also facilitate new entry to the Czech non-life insurance markets for companies that do not
    have own distribution network.
62. The market investigation indicated that brokers' importance in the non-life insurance
    market is expected to increase43. Large brokers consider that they are usually able to
    exercise buying power vis-à-vis the insurance companies44. Further, they normally
    distribute insurance products of various insurance companies45 in all individual segments
    of the non-life insurance market46.
63. Generali claims that customers can easily switch suppliers in the non-life insurance
    markets without any significant switching costs. Non-life policies can generally be
    terminated by the customer every year, six weeks before the anniversary of the policy.
    The market investigation clearly confirmed that switching suppliers of non-life insurance
    is easy and does not involve significant costs47. Therefore, as there are also no meaningful
    capacity constraints on the supply-side (see paragraph 52 above), customers can easily
    switch to a different insurance company in response to increased premiums or reduced
    services of their existing insurer. This is also documented by the decreasing trend of the
    market share of CP in the past which lost customers to the benefit of smaller competitors.
    Further, in particular large customers can usually exercise some buying power vis-à-vis
    the insurance companies48.

64. As indicated above, the transaction combines the first and the fourth largest non-life
    insurance companies active in the Czech Republic leading to a combined market share on
    the overall non-life insurance market of almost 43%. The transaction would lead to
    substantial combined market shares ranging between [25-50%] also on the individual
    segments of the non-life insurance market. However, the actual increment to the currently
    already high market shares of CP provided by the addition of Generali is rather modest,
    amounting to around [5-10%] on the overall market and ranging between [0-10%] on
    individual segments. As mentioned above, CP is, due to historical reasons, already now
    the number one supplier of non-life insurance both on the overall market as well as on all
    but one of the individual segments (the only exception is liability insurance where
    Kooperativa was the leading supplier in 2006). Therefore, the structural change of the
    market due to the merger is limited and, as Generali is not considered as the maverick, its
    elimination as one of the existing competitors to CP does not affect significantly the
    competitive conditions on the market.
65. In addition, as indicated above, the insurance companies do not face any important
    capacity constraints or barriers to entry or expansion and at the same time customers are
    able to switch easily between providers. This means that in case the merged entity raised
    prices or deteriorated insurance conditions, customers would be able to switch to
    alternative suppliers which could then expand their activities. Therefore, even though the
    merger would strengthen the leading position of CP, the remaining competitors (most of
    which belong to established and financially strong European insurance groups) would still
    provide sufficient competitive constraints to the merged entity. Furthermore, even though
    the Czech non-life insurance market's dynamics are lower than in case of life insurance, it
    is still expected to grow further and thus provide additional opportunities for expansion of
    existing or entry of new competitors (such as AXA that has recently entered the Czech life
    insurance market or other potential entrants mentioned above).
66. Some respondents to the market investigation indicated that the strengthened position of
    CP/Generali would provide the merged entity with an advantage vis-à-vis brokers and
    could thus make access to the independent distribution channels more difficult for other
    insurance companies. However, the market investigation did not confirm that such effects
    of the transaction would be likely. First, the actual change of the market position of CP
    resulting from the merger is limited and unlikely to change in a significant way its
    position vis-à-vis brokers. Second, the investigation showed that, although CP is already
    now a clear number one provider of non-life insurance services, brokers actually offer
    insurance products of a variety of suppliers. Third, brokers are valued by customers for
    their independence and ability to compare different products offered by insurance
    companies in order to find the best solution for the customer49. There are no indications
    that a minor change in the structure of supply would make them preferring the merged
    entity's products and thus jeopardising their reputation of independence and market
    knowledge. Fourth, brokers seem to have a significant buying power vis-à-vis the
    providers of non-life insurance services (representing almost [50-55%] of all new
    premiums). Finally, a majority of competitors as well as intermediaries indicated that the
    merger is not likely to have any negative effects on the access to independent distribution
    channels.
67. For these reasons, the transaction does not lead to competition concerns due to unilateral
    effects in the overall non-life insurance sector in the Czech Republic.
49  See replies to question 21 of the questionnaire to customers.

68. The above described arguments also largely apply to all individual segments of the non-
    life insurance market in the Czech Republic. However, as there are certain specific
    features of at least some of these segments, these are discussed individually below.
      (i) Accident and sickness insurance
69. The addition of Generali increases the market share of CP only by [0-5] percentage points
    to [40-45%]. However, Generali was in fact one of the smallest competitors on this market
    segment and the merging parties would face significant competition by a large number of
    competitors (Kooperativa, Allianz, CSOB, Pojistovna CS, Cardif, ING and AIG) with
    market shares ranging between [5-15%]. Other smaller competitors are also active on this
    market including a recent entrant Slavia. In addition, ACE has announced entry to this
    market segment in May 2007.
70. Further, as the above described characteristics of the non-life insurance market largely
    apply also to this segment, the transaction does not raise any competition concerns on this
    particular market segment.
      (ii) Motor vehicle insurance
71. While the combined merged entity's market share [45-50%] (CP [40-45%], Generali [5-
    10%]) is significant, the increment caused by the transaction is modest and the merged
    entity would face competition from other established providers such as Kooperativa ([30-
    35%] market share), Allianz ([10-15%]), CSOB [5-10%] and UNIQA [0-5%]. Further,
    since liberalisation of the motor third party liability (MTPL) insurance in 200050, there
    were numerous new entrants to this market including recent entries by Wüstenrot in 2006
    or Direct and Dolnorakouská pojištovna in 2007 while possible new future entrants
    include such established insurance companies as AXA or ACE.
72. Even if the motor vehicle insurance market is further subdivided into Casco insurance and
    MTPL insurance as suggested by some respondents, the market structure would be similar
    to the overall market. In Casco insurance the combined market share would amount to
    [45-50%] (CP [35-40%], Generali [5-10%]) while in MTPL insurance the combined
    market share would amount to [45-50%] (CP [40-45%], Generali [5-10%]). In both sub-
    segments the same competitors as on the overall motor vehicle insurance market are
    active with comparatively similar market shares.
73. Further, the reply of the Czech Insurers Bureau (a professional organisation of MTPL
    insurers) indicates that the transaction would not affect the MTPL insurance market and
    that it is likely that other existing and newly entering competitors will attack the merged
    entity and also that some of its existing customers may leave due to the foreseen
    transaction51.
74. Further, as the above described characteristics of the non-life insurance market largely
    apply also to this segment, the transaction does not raise any competition concerns on this
    particular market segment or its possible two sub-segments.
50  Until then CP was according to the relevant legislation the monopoly provider of MTPL insurance in the
    Czech Republic.

                                                           15

      (iii) Property insurance
75. The combined market share of the merged entity in the property insurance segment would
    amount to [45-50%] (CP [35-40%], Generali [5-10%]). Even though Generali's market
    share is the highest of all non-life insurance segments where it is present, the combined
    entity would still face significant competition from Kooperativa ([30-35%] market share),
    Allianz ([5-10%]), CSOB ([0-5%]), UNIQA ([0-5%]) and AIG ([0-5%]). In addition,
    ACE has announced its entry to this market segment in may 2007 while AXA is a possible
    future entrant to this market. Further, Generali argues that FOS suppliers are particularly
    active on this market with an estimated [5-10%] market share as large companies assisted
    by brokers (which are particularly important in this segment representing alone around
    [55-60%] of the new premiums) are actually using FOS providers as their property
    insurance suppliers.
76. Further, as the above described characteristics of the non-life insurance market largely
    apply also to this segment, the transaction does not raise any competition concerns on this
    particular market segment.
      (iv) Marine, Aviation and Transport (MAT) insurance
77. It is emphasised that the geographic market for MAT insurance is most likely at least EEA
    wide and the combined market share of the parties on such market would be well below
    15%.
78. However, even if a narrower national market is considered, the combined market share of
    the merged entity would be lower than in other non-life insurance segments, amounting to
    [35-40%] (CP [30-35%], Generali [0-5%]). Further, the merged entity would face
    significant competitors including Allianz ([30-35%] market share), Kooperativa ([10-
    15%]), CSOB ([5-10%]), AIG ([5-10%]) or UNIQA ([0-5%]).
79. Further, as the above described characteristics of the non-life insurance market largely
    apply also to this segment, the transaction does not raise any competition concerns on this
    particular market segment.
      (v) Liability insurance
80. The combined market share of the merged entity in the liability insurance segment would
    amount to [35-40%] (CP [30-35%], Generali [5-10%]). The combined entity would still
    face significant competition from Kooperativa ([35-40%] market share), Allianz ([5-
    10%]), AIG ([0-5%]) and CSOB ([0-5%]). In addition, ACE is believed to be a potential
    entrant in this segment.
81. Further, as the above described characteristics of the non-life insurance market largely
    apply also to this segment, the transaction does not raise any competition concerns on this
    particular market segment.
      (vi) Credit and suretyship insurance
82. The combined market share of the merged entity in the credit and suretyship insurance
    market segment would amount to [40-45%], however the increment brought by Generali
    would be insignificant ([0-5%]). The merged entity would face competition in particular
    by the EGAP/KUP specialised in this market segment with [35-40%] market share. Other
    competitors include insurance companies well established in this market segment such as
    Cardif ([5-10%]) or a subsidiary of Allianz - Euler ([5-10%]).
                                                   16

83. It is noted that CP's strong position on this market is partly due to the fact that its
    consumer credit insurance is distributed mainly together with consumer credits offered by
    Home Credit, a subsidiary of PPF. These sales represent [90-100%] of CP's sales of credit
    and suretyship insurance. As the transaction agreements do not provide for […] and as
    PPF will no longer be controlling CP (despite its significant shareholding in Newco – see
    above paragraphs 6and following), the transaction would weaken the link between CP's
    consumer credit insurance and Home Credit's activities and Home Credit would be free to
    distribute insurance from other suppliers with its consumer credit.
84. In addition, according to the CNB report, credit insurance recorded in 2006 showed the
    strongest growth of all non-life insurance segments due to growth in premiums by 80%52.
85. Even if the credit and suretyship insurance is further subdivided in line with previous
    Commission's practice into (i) delcredere insurance, (ii) capital goods insurance, (iii)
    consumer credit, (iv) fidelity insurance and (v) guarantee insurance, the transaction is
    unlikely to raise competition concerns. Neither CP nor Generali provide delcredere
    insurance, capital goods insurance or fidelity insurance in the Czech Republic. Even
    though CP is (due to its connection to Home Credit which is in fact weakened by the
    transaction) a significant provider of consumer credit insurance, the activities of Generali
    in this sub-segment are negligible (leading to an estimated market share below [1%]). The
    only real overlap between the parties activities is then in guarantee insurance but the
    combined market share of the parties amounts to [35-40%] (CP [10-15%], Generali [20-
    25%]) and the parties would face significant competition of EGAP/KUP ([25-30%]
    market share), Kooperativa ([15-20%]) or UNIQA ([10-15%]).
86. Further, as the above described characteristics of the non-life insurance market largely
    apply also to this segment, the transaction does not raise any competition concerns on this
    particular market segment.
      (vii) Travel insurance
87. The combined market share of the merged entity in the travel insurance market segment is
    the lowest of all non-life insurance segments amounting to [25-30%] (CP [20-25%],
    Generali [0-5%]). The merged entity would face significant competition from a number of
    strong competitors such as VZP ([20-25%] market share), Kooperativa ([10-15%]),
    Evropská cestovní ([10-15%]), Komercní pojištovna ([5-10%]), CSOB ([5-10%]) or
    UNIQA ([0-5%]).
88. In view of the modest combined market share and as the above described characteristics
    of the non-life insurance market largely apply also to this segment, the transaction does
    not raise any competition concerns on this particular market segment.
      Co-ordinated effects
89. A merger in a concentrated market may also significantly impede effective competition by
    way of coordinated effects, namely if it increases the likelihood that firms are able to
    coordinate their behaviour.53
90. The non-life insurance sector (especially some of the possible market segmentations
    analysed above) can be characterised as concentrated based on the small number of major
52  See CNB Financial Market Supervision Report 2006, page 45 and 76.

    concentrations between undertakings, para 40.
                                                      17

    competitors. Although non-life insurance involves a large number of products with
    varying degrees of product differentiation, co-ordination could in principle be facilitated
    by the resulting multi-market contact and the high frequency of interaction. Conceivable
    tacit co-ordination mechanisms include pricing as well as more subtle mechanisms, for
    example a tacit allocation of certain customer groups among insurers (e.g. by not
    competing aggressively outside historical areas of expertise). The results of the market
    investigation seem to indicate that the insurance market is sufficiently transparent to reach
    terms of co-ordination. Competitors indicate that prices are easy to monitor as well as
    competitors' general conditions and that competitors tend to monitor other operators'
    prices and insurance conditions.54
91. However, despite this apparent market transparency, the results of the market
    investigation also indicate that the proposed operation is unlikely to give raise to
    coordinated effects. Based on its market investigation, the Commission has no indications
    that the main insurers are already at present co-ordinating their competitive behaviour55.
    There are also no indications that Generali has played a decisive role in preventing co-
    ordination, relative to other smaller competitors.
92. Additionally, for coordination to be successful, the actions of non-coordinating companies
    and potential competitors, as well as customers, should not be able to jeopardise the
    outcome expected from coordination56. In the present case there would seem to be
    significant competitive constraints present on the market which would destabilise any
    attempt at coordination. These constraints would in particular stem from effective
    competition from recent entrants. Moreover, as stated above (paragraphs 52 and
    following), there are no capacity constraints in the non-life insurance market, barriers to
    entry are rather limited and new entry is expected in the future.
93. Finally, it should be noted that, notwithstanding the concentration levels of the overall
    non-life insurance market, reports indicate that the market is at present competitive and
    expected to grow. In particular, as indicated above (paragraph 73) the Czech Insurers
    Bureau considers that the MTPL insurance (the highest concentrated non-life insurance
    market) in the Czech Republic is a growing one and that the future share of the joint
    venture will be decreasing since they expect that "existing and newly coming competitors
    will attack the joint venture".57
94. Based on the above market characteristics and the possibilities for outsiders to prevent
    coordination, the notified transaction does not raise serious doubts with regard to co-
    ordinated effects.
      B.3. Other markets – assistance services
95. EuropAssistance, belonging to the Generali group, offers travel assistance ([0-5%] of the
    Czech market) and road assistance ([5-10%] of the Czech market) which are usually sold as
    part of motor and travel insurance respectively. CP is not active in assistance services but
    uses other providers of assistance services.
96. The Commission analysed whether the combination of travel and motor insurance activities
    of CP and Generali could have vertical effects in view of their connection with assistance
54  See replies to questions 20 and 21 of the questionnaire to competitors.
55  The Czech Competition Authority reached the same conclusion in Case S 180/03-3845/03, Kooperativa
    pojist’ovna/Pojist’ovna Ceske sporitelny, 5 November 2003.

    services offered by Generali. However, the market shares of Generali in the assistance
    markets are relatively small and there are large competitors such as AXA Assistance and
    Elvia Assistance, which are also part of large international insurance groups and hold very
    significant market shares58. Therefore, the merged entity would not be able to foreclose its
    competitors in the motor and travel insurance markets from access to assistance services.
    Further, the combined entity would not be able to foreclose the upstream providers of
    assistance services competing with Generali from access to customers, as it will not have
    market power on the downstream travel and motor insurance markets (see above) and there
    are significant competitors to the merged entity on these markets.
97. The market investigation clearly confirmed that the transaction would not have any negative
    effects on the upstream assistance services59. Therefore, the transaction does not lead to any
    competition concerns relating to the vertical relationship between Generali's assistance
    services on the one hand and the merged entity's activities on the motor and travel insurance
    markets on the other hand.
VI. CONCLUSION
98. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified operation
    and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA Agreement. This
    decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No
    139/2004.
