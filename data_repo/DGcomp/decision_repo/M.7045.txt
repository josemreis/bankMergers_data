    of parts of Pastor Vida, S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros ("the Acquired Business", Spain) via
    Allianz Popular, S.L (Spain) by way of purchase of assets.

        -        for Allianz: insurance and asset management worldwide;
        -        for BPE: banking, insurance and asset management, mainly in Spain and Portugal,
                 but also in the United States;
        -        for the Acquired Business: life risk, and pension funds activities in Spain.
