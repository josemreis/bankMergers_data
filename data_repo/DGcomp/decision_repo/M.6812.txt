T0 the notifying party:
Dear Sir/Madam,
Subject: Case No COMP/M.6812 - SFPI/ DEXIA
Commission decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of Council Regulation
No 139/20041
1. On 18 January 2013, the European Commission received noti<U+FB01>cation of a proposed
concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/20042 by Which
the Société Fédérale de Participations et d'Investissement / Federale Participatie- e11
Investeringsmaatschappij ("SFPI/FPIM") acquires sole control over DeXia SA/NV
("Dexia").3 SFPI/FPIM and DeXia are designated hereinafter as the "Parties" and
SFPI/FPIM as the "Notifying Party".
(1) THE PARTIES
2. SFPI/FPIM is an investment company fully owned by the Belgian State. The investment
portfolio of SFPI/FPIM consists of stakes in public and private enterprises of strategic
interest to the Belgian State. SFPI/FPIM has three core activities: participation in public

the Functioning of the European Union ("TFEU") has introduced certain changes, such as the
replacement of "Community" by "Union" and "common market" by "internal market". The
terminology of the TFEU Will be used throughout this decision.

and private enterprises, investment in enterprises with an important social value in one
of the priority sectors selected by SFPI/FPIM, and contribution to policies of the Belgian
federal government and implementation of proj ects on its behalf.

3. DeXia is a <U+FB01>nancial institution with its registered seat in Belgium, which offers <U+FB01>nancial
services in several countries, mainly in France through DeXia Credit Local ("DCL"), as
well as elsewhere in Europe through a number of subsidiaries. DeXia is a limited liability
company under Belgian law with its shares listed on Euronext Brussels and Paris as well
as on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. DeXia focuses its activities on public <U+FB01>nance,
including project <U+FB01>nance. As a result of the <U+FB01>nancial crisis, and its ensuing <U+FB01>nancial
dif<U+FB01>culties which resulted in the need for signi<U+FB01>cant State support, DeXia has been
selling off all of its strategic operational entities since October 2011. This included a sale
of its subsidiary DeXia Banque Belgique (DBB) which has been divested t0 the
SFPI/FPIM who subsequently rebranded these assets under the commercial name Bel<U+FB01>us
Banque et Assurances ("Bel<U+FB01>us"). As a result, DeXia has no longer signi<U+FB01>cant presence
in retail banking and more generally, its actiVities in Belgium are minimal.

(2) THE OPERATION AND THE PROCEDURE

4. The DeXia group has faced severe <U+FB01>nancial challenges since the <U+FB01>nancial crisis that
started around 2008. After failed restructuring attempts and due to a deteriorating
<U+FB01>nancial situation of DeXia early 2012 the Belgian, French and Luxembourg States
decided to prepare an orderly resolution plan for the DeXia group (the "Orderly
Resolution Plan"). On 7 November 2012, DeXia's board of directors (the "B0ard")
acknowledged that, following the losses incurred predominantly as a result of the
impairment of DeXia's stake in DCL, DeXia's net assets had been reduced to EUR -2.685
billion. Given that this amount was lower than one of the thresholds set out in Article
633 of the Belgian Company Code, the Board was obliged to convene an extraordinary
general meeting of the shareholders in order for them to vote on the continuation of
DeXia's activities or, alternatively, its dissolution. At this extraordinary general meeting
held on 21 December 2012, the shareholders approved the Board's proposal for a
continuation of DeXia's actiVities along with the recapitalization 0f DeXia through a
capital increase reserved to the Belgian and French States.

5. On 12 December 2012, pursuant to Article 7(3) of the Merger Regulation the Notifying
Party applied for a derogation from the suspension obligation provided for in Article
7(1) of the Merger Regulation with regard to the proposed acquisition by "SFPI/FPIM"
0f sole control over DeXia. By decision of 17 December 20124 the Commission
concluded that whilst the suspension obligation could seriously affect the <U+FB01>nancial
situation of the DeXia group along with the wider <U+FB01>nancial community, no threat to
competition caused by the operation could be identi<U+FB01>ed. The Commission, thus,
considered that a derogation from the standstill obligation did not appear to have adverse
effects on one or more of the parties or on any third party and granted the derogation
from the suspension obligation.

6. As a result, on 31 December 2012, following the Extraordinary General Meeting of 21
December 2012 and the Commission's Article 7(3) Decision of 17 December 2012, a
capital increase of DeXia took place for a total amount of EUR 5.5 billion. The Belgian

4 See Commission Decision C(2012) 9836.

2


State, acting through SFPI/FPIM, subscribed to the capital increase for an amount of
EUR 2.915 billion while the French State subscribed to the capital increase for an
amount of EUR 2.585 billion. This capital increase was intended to allow DeXia to
continue the implementation of its orderly resolution, in accordance with the terms of the
Revised Orderly Resolution Plan approved by the Commission 011 28 December 2012 in
the context of the State aid proceedingss, as well as to allow for the run off of assets until
their maturity.

7. Prior to the capital increase, DeXia's capital was divided between various shareholders
("the existing shareholders") with 110 single shareholder having control over DeXia
within the meaning of the Merger Regulati0n6. The recapitalization has resulted in the
dilution of the shares of other shareholders and in the Belgian State, through SFPI/FPIM,
holding a 50.02% share in DeXia and France holding a 44.4% share, with the remainder
(5.58%) being held by the previous shareholders (excluding the Belgian and French
States).

8. In accordance with the Orderly Resolution Plan7 and the agreement between the two
States, the French State, participating in the recapitalization with an amount of EUR
2.585 billion and acquiring a stake of 44.40% does not control, directly or indirectly,
DeXia. Indeed, the shareholding 0f the Belgian State entitles SFPI/FPIM to appoint <U+FB01>ve
out of nine members of the Board. All decisions, including strategic decisions such as
the internal re-organization 0f the bank, are taken by a simple majority. As a result, all
strategic decisions may be adopted by SFPI/FPIM alone and the French State has 110 veto
rights over these decisions. The French State possesses normal minority shareholding
protection rights, but it has 110 veto rights over important strategic business decisions.

9. It follows that the recapitalization 0f DeXia results in the Belgian State, through
SFPI/FPIM, acquiring sole control over DeXia.

(3) THE CONCENTRATION

10. Similarly to cases where control is acquired by private undertakings, in situations where
private companies are reeapitalized by the State it has to be <U+FB01>rst established, on a case-
by-case basis, whether a transaction gives rise to the acquisition of control and therefore
constitutes a concentration within the meaning of Article 3 0f the Merger Regulation,
and if so, whether such concentration meets the turnover thresholds set out in Article 5
0f the Merger Regulation.

11. The Commission has previously assessed under the Merger Regulation a number of
reeapitalizations of banks by States resulting in acquisition by the State concerned of
control over the bank in question, notably in the ease of the recapitalization 0f the German

5 See Commission Decision C (2012) 9962 <U+FB01>nal of 28 December 2012, not yet published.

6 Before the capital increase, the shares of DeXia were held as follow: Caisse des Dépéts et
Consignations (17.61%); Holding Communal (14.26%); Arco Group (10.19%); Belgian State Via
SFPI/FPIM (5.73%); French State (5.73%); Ethias Group (5.04%); CNP Assurances (2.96%);
Flemish Region Via the Vlaams Toekomstfonds (2.87%); Walloon Region (2.01%); Brussels Region
(0.86%); Employees (0.57%); Other institutional and individual shareholders — free <U+FB02>oat (32.17%).

bank Hypo Real Estate (HRE) by the German Federal State Via the Financial Market
Stabilisation Fund SoFFinS, as well as in the ease of the recapitalization by Austria of the
bank Hypo Group Alpe Adria9.

12. In order to establish the Commission's jurisdiction in cases when private undertakings
are reoapitalized by the State, a two-step approach is followed. In a first step, it is
analysed whether there is acquisition of control over the target conferring to the
acquiring party the possibility of exercising decisive in<U+FB02>uence over it. If it is concluded
that the transaction would give rise to the acquisition of control and the loss of
independent power of decision, then, in a second step, in order to establish the
undertakings to be taken into account for the purpose of the calculation of the turnover,
it is analysed at which level of the state entity the independent power of decision would
lie.

13. Consequently, in order to establish whether or not the acquisition of by the Belgian State
Via SFPI/FPIM constitutes a concentration noti<U+FB01>able under the Merger Regulation the
Commission <U+FB01>rst needs to establish whether SFPI/FPIM (or an entity above it) will have
the possibility to exercise decisive in<U+FB02>uence over DeXia or whether DeXia will, post-
transaotion, constitute an economic unit that retains an independent power of decision. If
the latter is not clearly the case, it will be considered that the transaction gives rise to an
acquisition of control over DeXia and therefore, as a second step, it needs to be
established which is the ultimate acquiring entity (SFPI/FPIM or an entity ultimately
controlling SFPI/FPIM if the latter cannot be considered having an independent power of
decision) in order to determine which undertakings need to be considered for the purpose
of calculating relevant turnover.

Assessment ofindependentpower ofdecision ofDexia post-transaction

14. SFPI/FPIM has acquired a controlling stake in DeXia and there is no holding arrangement,
special provisions or other safeguards in place that would ensure that DeXia retains an
independent power of decision post—transaotion. Indeed, there are no provisions that would
indicate that post—transaotion the strategy, business plan and budget of DeXia would be
decided autonomously, neither are there any provisions that would result in <U+FB01>Jture separate
management of SFPI/FPIM. Consequently, it cannot be excluded that, post—transaotion,
DeXia will be subj eot to coordination of its commercial conduct with other entities
controlled by the Belgian State or by SFPI/FPIM such as in particular Bel<U+FB01>us.

15. As a result, in the case at hand, it cannot be considered that DeXia, post-transaotion would
remain an economic unit with an independent power of decision. It is therefore concluded
for the purpose of the present decision that SFPI/FPIM acquired control over DeXia in the
sense of Article 3 of the Merger Regulation.

Assessment of undertakings to be taken into account for the purpose of calculation of

turnover

16. To establish which undertakings, amongst all those controlled by the State, should be
considered for the establishment of jurisdiction under the EC Merger Regulation, recital

8 See Case No COMP/M.5508 — SOFFIN/ Hypo Real Estate, OJ C 147 of 27.06.2009, p. 8.

9 See Case No COMP/M.5 861 - REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA/ HYPO GROUP ALPE ADRIA

4


22 sets out that "[Ijn the public sector, calculation of the turnover of an undertaking
concerned in a concentration needs, therefore, to take account of undertakings making
up an economic unit with independent power of decision, irrespective of the way in
which their capital is held 0r 0f the rules of administrative supervision applicable to
them".

17. Therefore, the Commission needs to identify the ultimate acquiring entity and analyse
Whether there are other undertakings controlled (directly or indirectly, solely or jointly)
by this entity Which should be taken into account for the purpose of the calculation of
turnover in the sense of article 5 of the Merger Regulation. This is because other
undertakings controlled by the same ultimate acquiring entity Within the meaning of the
Merger Regulation may be subject to coordination With DeXia in the sense that they
jointly constitute one centre of deoision-making and Will therefore need to be considered
for the purpose of calculating relevant turnover.

18. In the public sector, as regards the allocation of turnover for State-owned undertakings,
separate entities may be identi<U+FB01>ed as autonomous entities having independent decision-
making powers, not subj eot to coordination of their commercial behaviour or strategies
With other State-owned holdings“). Such separate entities should be treated as
independent and their turnover is not added together for the purposes of the application
of Article 5 of the EC Merger Regulation“.

19. Thus, in the case of the acquisition of an undertaking by a State, or by a State-owned
undertaking, in order to calculate the turnover for the purposes of Article 1 of the Merger
Regulation With regard to the buyer, account must be taken only of the turnover of those
State-owned undertakings Which are under the same independent power of commercial
deoision-making12.

20. In the case at hand, since SFPI/FPIM already controls at least one undertaking, namely
Bel<U+FB01>us, regarding which there are no special holding arrangements in place that would
ensure independent power of decision, SFPI/FPIM will be considered as the economic unit
which is the starting point for the assessment. The Commission needs to assess Whether
SFPI/FPIM constitutes an economic unit With independent power of decision or Whether
decisions are made at a higher level than SFPI/FPIM, namely by the Belgian State itself in
Which case the turnover of other undertakings than those controlled by SFPI/FPIM would
need to be added for the purpose of calculating the turnover to be taken into account to
establish jurisdiction in this case.

21. However, given that, for the purpose of establishing the EU dimension of this transaction it
is suf<U+FB01>cient to include the turnover of SFPI/FPIM (which includes Bel<U+FB01>us), the question of
Who is the ultimate controlling entity above SFPI/FPIM can be left open for the purpose of
the present case.

(4) EU DIMENSION

22. The undertakings concerned have a combined aggregate world-Wide turnover of more
than EUR 5 000 million” (SFPI/FPIM: EUR [. . .]; DeXia: EUR [. . .]). Each 0fthem has
a EU-Wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million (SFPI/FPIM: EUR [. . .]; DeXia : [. . .]
), but they do not achieve more than twc-thirds of their aggregate EU-Wide turnover
Within one and the same Member State.

23. The noti<U+FB01>ed operation therefore has an EU dimension pursuant to Article 1(2) of the
Merger Regulation.

(5) COMPETITIVE ASSESSMENT

A. Relevant product and geographic markets

24. SFPI/FPIM, through its controlling stake in Bel<U+FB01>us, is mainly active in Belgium,
primarily in retail and corporate banking, and to a more limited extent, in public <U+FB01>nance
and insurance. As submitted by the Notifying Party, neither SFPI/FPIM nor the Belgian
state holds any controlling interests in any other <U+FB01>nancial institution or in any vertically
related businesses.

25. DeXia's main actiVities relate to <U+FB01>nancial services for the public sector (e.g. the offering
of credit to local actiVities and project <U+FB01>nance) and asset management. Therefore, the
proposed transaction gives rise to a very limited horizontal overlap in the area of public
<U+FB01>nance in Belgium and to a vertical overlap between the distribution and the
management of investment products in the asset management market in Belgium.

Public <U+FB01>nance

26. In the past, the Commission considered that <U+FB01>nancial services to public authorities are a
separate product market given that both the customers and the market conditions differ
from these existing for corporate bankingM. In previous decisions, the Commission has
considered that a distinction should be made between the different products (e.g. prcj ect
<U+FB01>nance) as well as the different types of public authorities (local, regional, national,
federal etc)”. In particular, credit to local authorities has been considered a product in
its own right, given that customers and conditions of loans differ from normal bank
loans”.

27. While the bulk of DeXia's remaining actiVity is indeed in this product market, it is
envisaged that the majority of its subsidiaries Will be wound down or divested in the very
near <U+FB01>Jture. In fact, in line With its orderly resolution plan, DeXia has a cap on the total new

13 Turnover calculated in accordance With Article 5(1) of the Merger Regulation and the Commission

Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice (OJ C95, 16.04.2008, p.1).

production of EUR 600 million for the years 2013 and 2014, and is not allowed any new
production afterwards. So as of 2015 it will have no market presence in France and
Belgium in terms of <U+FB02>ows (new production) and will be sealing down market presence in
terms of stock”.

28. As regards the geographic scope of the market, the Commission has previously found that
the market for credit to local authorities is nationallg. The Notifying Party agrees with
this de<U+FB01>nition.

29. For the purpose of the current case, it is, however, not necessary to de<U+FB01>ne the exact
scope of the product and geographic market as the transaction does not raise serious
doubts as to its compatibility with the internal market in the public <U+FB01>nance sector,
irrespective of the precise market de<U+FB01>nition.

Asset management

30. Asset management oonoems the provision of investment advice and often also the
implementation of this advice. Asset management may also include creation and managing
of mutual <U+FB01>l<U+FB02>dS which are then marketed on an "off—the-shelf' basis, including to retail
customers, and the provision of portfolio management services for institutional investors
(pension <U+FB01>ands, institutions, international organisations). In the latter case, the de<U+FB01>nition of
the investment strategy will, as a rule, be based on the individual requirements of the
customer. In most Member States, mutual <U+FB01>l<U+FB02>dS are constituted under either the law of
contract or under trust law and, thus, do not have legal personality. Asset management may
also include the provision of custody services related to assetmanagement19.

31. In previous cases, the Commission considered that one may distinguish a relevant product
market for asset management, including the creation and managing of mutual <U+FB01>l<U+FB02>dS for
retail clients and the tailor-made <U+FB01>l<U+FB02>dS for corporate and institutional customers, as well as
portfolio management for private investors, pension <U+FB01>l<U+FB02>dS and institutions”. The
Commission has, however left open the question whether these individual products
constitute separate relevant product markets, with the exception of asset management
services for private individuals which has been considered to constitute a separate
market”.

32. As regards the geographic scope of the market, the Notifying Party submits that the
relevant market should be regarded as national, as asset management is, in its View, a
segment of the retail banking sector. In previous decisions, the Commission has also found
that the relevant geographic market for the production of asset management products may

17 In line with its resolution plan, Dexia in principle cannot have any new production. In addition to the

exceptionally allowed above mentioned cap of EUR 600 million related to existing clients, there is a
limited possibility of new production in DeXia Crediop, an Italian subsidiary of DeXia (EUR 200
million in 2013) and no cap for DeXia Israel.

be national and is at most EEA wide in scope depending on the speci<U+FB01>cities of the case at
hand. Owing to the importance of national distribution channels, distribution of asset
management products to private individuals was considered to inherit the geographic scope
of the retail banking market and therefore to be national in scope”.

33. For the purpose of the current case, it is, however, not necessary to de<U+FB01>ne the exact scope
of the product and geographic market as the transaction does not raise serious doubts as to
its compatibility with the internal market in the asset management sector, irrespective of
the precise market de<U+FB01>nition.

B. Assessment

34. The Parties' actiVities in the banking sector are largely complementary. SFPI/FPIM is
active in retail banking in Belgium through its 100% controlling stake in Bel<U+FB01>us, whereas
DeXia no longer has any presence in retail or corporate banking in Belgium. The main
actiVities of DeXia relate to <U+FB01>nancial services to the public sector outside of Belgium, e.g.
public bonds and project <U+FB01>nance, principally in France, and asset management. Neither
SPFI/FPIM nor DeXia has a substantial presence outside Belgium and France. SFPI/FPIM
generates [0-5%] of its turnover outside Belgium (in Luxembourg and the Netherlands)
and DeXia generates nearly [50-60%]% of its turnover in France, with the remainder
divided between Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the UK. There is only one
vertical relationship between the Parties in Belgium as regards the asset management
actiVity (between production and distribution).

35. In addition, it is noted that, as a bank in run-off, DeXia is either divesting or winding
down its subsidiaries and reducing its actiVities to management of existing portfolios.
Indeed, DeXia's asset management subsidiary (DAM) is in the process of being divested.
On 12 December 2012, DeXia signed an SPA with GCS Capital for the sale of DAM,
which is expected to close in the <U+FB01>rst months of 2013. Once this sale is complete, DeXia
will eXit the asset management market completely. Similarly, as concerns DeXia's public
<U+FB01>nance arm, following the sale of DeXia's French public <U+FB01>nance subsidiary (DMA) to the
French State, completed on 31 J anuary 2013, DeXia will no longer active in the public
<U+FB01>nance sector, at the very least in Belgium.

Public <U+FB01>nance

36. SFPI/FPIM, through Bel<U+FB01>us, is active in the public <U+FB01>nance sector only in Belgium with
market shares estimated between [50-60%]23 .

37. DeXia is active mainly in France (where it achieved approximately [50-60%] of its total
turnover in 2011) with an estimated market share of [10-20%] in terms of new loans at the
end of 2011 and [0-5%] as of June 2012. DeXia is also active in Germany, Italy, Portugal,
Spain and UK, with market shares below [5-10%] in each of those countries. However,

22 See Case No COMP/M.3894 — Unicredito/ HVB (OJ C278, 11.11.2005, p.17) and Case No

COMP/M.5728 -CREDIT AGRICOLE/SOCIETE GENERALE ASSET MANAGEMENT, recital 84
(OJ C 107, 27.04.2010, p.l).
23 Bel<U+FB01>us used to be directly active in France through several subsidiaries. Bel<U+FB01>us has divested or
terminated all of these activities, as a result of which its market share in France has diminished to the
point of being negligible (less than 1%).
8


following the sale of DeXia's French public <U+FB01>nance subsidiary (DMA) to the French State
Which took place on 31 J anuary 2013, DeXia is active in the public <U+FB01>nance sector in France
only to a very limited extent, having to respect the cap on new production of EUR 600
million to be used in strictly de<U+FB01>ned cases With relation to existing loans.

38. As regards the Belgian market, the Notifying Party submits that it cannot be entirely
excluded at this stage that DeXia (through its subsidiary DCL) may be a party to some very
limited public <U+FB01>nance proj ects deals in Belgium. However, due to the very small
involvement of DeXia in the Belgian market and the eXit of DCL from this market
following the sale of DMA24 on 31 J anuary 2013, this overlap is de minimis.

39. In light of the above, it can be concluded that the transaction does not raise serious doubts
as to its compatibility With the internal market in relation to the public <U+FB01>nance market, and
this irrespective of the precise product and geographic market de<U+FB01>nition.

Asset management

40. SFPI/FPIM, through Bel<U+FB01>us, is active in the asset management sector only in Belgium,
With market shares estimated [0-5%] at both the production and distribution level.

41. DeXia, through its subsidiary DeXia Asset Management (DAM), provides asset
management services to retail clients through the bank distribution channels of banking
entities formerly part of the DeXia group, including Bel<U+FB01>us, as well as to institutional
clients, With a market share of [5-10%] in Belgium. However, pursuant to the SPA signed
between DeXia and GCS Capital on 12 December 2012, the closing of the DAM
transaction is due to take place in the <U+FB01>rst quarter of 2013, following Which DeXia will no
longer be active on this market.

42. Bel<U+FB01>us still continues to distribute some investment products (e.g. mutual <U+FB01>l<U+FB02>dS and
pension <U+FB01>nds) that are managed by DAM. The products distributed by Bel<U+FB01>us represent a
substantial part of the products managed by DAM25 . However, With a market share of [0-
5%] for Bel<U+FB01>us and [5-10%] for DeXia, the vertical relationship between Bel<U+FB01>us and DAM
is unlikely to give rise to any foreclosure effects.

43. In light of the above, it can be concluded that the transaction does not raise serious doubts
as to its compatibility With the internal market in relation to the asset management market,
and this irrespective of the precise product and geographic market de<U+FB01>nition.

24 Following the sale of DMA, DCL Will in principle no longer engage in new production. The sole

exception allows for a limited amount of production (EUR 600 million in total for 2013 and 2014)
intended to enable the restructuring of existing public structured loans.

25 [. . .] of DAM's total assets under management ("AUM") may be attributed to Belgium. This

corresponds to DAM holding a [5-10%] market share in Belgium. Of this [. . .], [. . .] is distributed by
Bel<U+FB01>us. This corresponds to Bel<U+FB01>us accounting for approximately [. . .] of DAM's AUM in Belgium.
The distribution of the remaining [...] may be attributed as follows: [...] distributed by DAM itself
and [. . .]distributed by a number of other banks.

(6) CONCLUSION
44. For the above reasons, the European Commission has decided not to oppose the noti<U+FB01>ed
operation and to declare it compatible With the internal market and with the EEA
Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) 0f the Merger
Regulation.

Subject : Case No COMP/M.6812- SFPI/ DEXIA

Commission decision pursuant to Article 7(3) of Council Regulation
N0 139/20041 - Request for derogation
1. We refer to your application for a derogation from the suspension obligation provided
for in Article 7(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 ("the Merger
Regulation") With regard to the proposed acquisition by Sooiété Fédérale de
Participations et d'Investissement / Federale Participatie-en Investeringsmaatschappij
("SFPI/FPIM") of sole control over DeXia SA/NV ("DeXia"), submitted pursuant to
Article 7(3) of the Merger Regulation on 12 December 2012.
I. THE PARTIES AND THE TRANSACTION
2. SFPI/FPIM is an investment company fully owned by the Belgian State. The
investment portfolio of SFPI/FPIM consists of stakes in public and private enterprises
of strategic interest to the Belgian State. SFPI/FPIM has three core activities:
participation in public and private enterprises, investment in enterprises With an
important social value in one of the priority sectors selected by SFPI/FPIM, and
contribution to policies of the Belgian federal government and implementation of
proj ects on its behalf.

3. DeXia is a financial institution With its registered seat in Belgium, Which offers
<U+FB01>nancial services in several countries, mainly in France through DeXia Credit Local
("DCL"), and in Europe, through a number of subsidiaries. DeXia focuses its activities
in public finance, including project <U+FB01>nance. It has no signi<U+FB01>cant presence in retail
banking and its activities in Belgium are minimal, since almost all of the Belgian
activities previously exercised under the DeXia brand have already been divested t0
the SPFI, Which has rebranded these assets under the commercial name Bel<U+FB01>us
Banque et Assurances ("Bel<U+FB01>us"). DeXia is a limited liability company under Belgian
law With its shares listed on Euronext Brussels and Paris as well as on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

Background

4. The DeXia group2 has faced severe financial challenges since the <U+FB01>nancial crisis that
started around 2008. The financial crisis (and consequently, the effects on DeXia)
deepened in 2011 following the worsening of the sovereign debt crisis and, more
generally, the decline of the macroeconomic environment. In that context, and in
order to avoid a rapid deterioration of DeXia’s liquidity situation and the snowball
effect of a systemic risk, the Belgian, French and Luxembourg States supported the
DeXia group and its restructuring plan by granting a guarantee on certain funding
raised by DeXia and DCL.

5. On October 2011, the DeXia group began to set in motion profound changes to its
structure. This involves, in particular, the sale of all its strategic operational entities,
including DeXia Banque Belgique ("DBB", now Bel<U+FB01>us), Which was sold to the
SFPI/FPIM, DeXia Banque Internationale a Luxembourg (now Banque Internationale
a Luxembourg, "BIL") and Deniz Bank (its Turkish subsidiary). The sale of Bel<U+FB01>us t0
the Belgian State was cleared from a merger control perspective by decision of the
Belgian competition authority on 2 December 2011.

6. As a consequence, in accordance With undertakings given in the context of the
approval of the temporary guarantee by the Commission and in order to obtain a
de<U+FB01>nitive approval of the guarantee, on 21 and 22 March 2012 the Belgian, French
and Luxembourg States <U+FB01>led an orderly resolution plan for the DeXia group With the
Commission (the “Orderly Resolution Plan”). This plan included the DeXia group's
strategy, a business plan and a presentation of the future outlook of the group, taking
into account in particular the sale of the operational entities.

7. During the third quarter of 2012, the Belgian, French and Luxembourg States and the
Commission actively continued discussions With a View to submitting a Revised
Orderly Resolution Plan for DeXia in keeping With State Aid rules. These discussions,
combined With the evolution of the market conditions, led to amendments to a
number of the principles and assumptions underlying the business plan upon Which
the Orderly Resolution Plan had been based.

8. On 7 November 2012, DeXia's board of directors (the "B0ard") acknowledged that,
following the losses incurred predominantly as a result of the impairment 0n DeXia’s

2 DeXia SA/NV is the parent company of DeXia group Which is an European banking group Which in
2011, carried out its activities principally in Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Turkey in the <U+FB01>elds of
retail and commercial banking, public and Wholesale banking, asset management and investor services.

stake in DCL, DeXia’s net assets had been reduced to EUR -2.685 billion. Given that
this amount was lower than one of the thresholds set out in Article 633 of the Belgian
Company Code ("BCC"), the Board was obliged to convene an extraordinary general
meeting of the shareholders in order for them to vote 011 the continuation of DeXia’s
activities or, alternatively, its dissolution. This general meeting of the shareholders is
scheduled to take place 011 21 December 2012.

9. The Board has proposed to the shareholders to continue DeXia's activities and has
proposed a reeapitalisation 0f DeXia through a capital increase reserved to the Belgian
and French States — in compliance With the minimum price rule set forth in Article
598 of the BCC — to restore DeXia's net assets.

Current operation

10. According to SFPI/FPIM, this capital increase Will amount to a total of EUR 5.5
billion3 in order to (i) restore DeXia’s net assets to a level above half the share capital,
(ii) satisfy all its contractual obligations Vis-a-Vis DCL and its subsidiaries and (iii)
enable it to proceed With a capital increase in DCL for an amount of EUR 2 billion.
The latter two transactions are considered by SFPI/FPIM as imperative in order to
allow DCL to continue to comply With its net stand-alone asset ratios.

11. The capital increase is intended also to allow DeXia to continue the implementation of
the orderly resolution of DeXia, in accordance With the terms of the Revised Orderly
Resolution Plan submitted to the Commission 011 10 December 2012, as well as to
allow for the run off of assets until their maturity.

12. The Belgian and French States expect that the share capital increase Will take place 011
31 December 2012 at the latest. This operation is conditional upon obtaining (i) all
legislative authorisations required for the subscription of the shares by both the
Belgian State (acting through SFPI/FPIM) and the French State, and (ii) the
authorisation by the European Commission pursuant to EU State aid rules.

13. As a result of the capital increase, Belgium's stake in DeXia Will increase to 50.02%
and France's stake Will increase to 44.40%4.

14. According to SFPI/FPIM, the 50.02% share in DeXia acquired by the Belgian State
Via SPFI/FPIM Will give the Belgian State sole control over DeXia. As the preference
shares to be subscribed to by the Belgian and French States Will entitle them to the
same voting rights as the existing shares, <U+FB01>ve out of nine members of the Board Will
be appointed by the Belgian State. As DeXia's decisions (including strategic
decisions) Will be taken by a simple majority, the Parties argue that post
reeapitalisation DeXia Will be solely controlled by SFPI/FPIMin the sense of the
Merger Regulation.

3 The Belgian State (acting directly through SFPI/FPIM, pursuant to a delegated mission) Will subscribe
to the capital increase for an amount of EUR 2.915 billion. The French State Will subscribe to the
capital increase for an amount of EUR 2.585 billion.

4 Currently, the stakes of Belgian and French States are both of 5.73% of the DeXia's capital. N0 existing
shareholders have a controlling stake. The proposed share capital increase would reduce the stake of
existing shareholders (excluding the Belgian and French States) from 100% to 5.58%,

3


11. EU DIMENSION

15. According to the information furnished by SFPI, the undertakings concerned have a
combined aggregate world-wide turnover of more than EUR 5 000 million. Each of
them has an EU-wide turnover in excess of EUR 250 million, and they do not both
achieve more than two-thirds of their aggregate EU-wide turnover within one and the
same Member State, since DeXia achieves well in excess of two-thirds of its turnover
in France. The proposed Transaction therefore has an EU dimension within the
meaning of Article 1(2) of the Merger Regulation.

16. For the avoidance of doubt, it should be speci<U+FB01>ed that the relevant turnover
thresholds are considered to be met based exclusively on the turnover of DeXia and
Bel<U+FB01>us as reported by SFPI/FPIM. This decision is therefore without prejudice to the
question of whether or not the SFPI enj oys an independent power of decision relative
to the Belgian State in the sense of recital 22 of the EUMR, as well as of the question
as to whether or not all of the undertakings in which the SFPI holds a controlling
stake are part of a single economic unit in the sense of that recital5.

III. THE APPLICATION FOR DEROGATION

17. SFPI/FPIM submits that it is essential that the recapitalisation of DeXia occurs by 31
December 2012. The reason for this urgency is that DeXia will need the funds to
recapitalise DCL, whose net assets will otherwise be insuf<U+FB01>cient at the end of the
<U+FB01>nancial year ending 31 December 2012. Such insuf<U+FB01>ciency could lead to the
downgrading of DCL's rating and trigger certain (cross-) default provisions in its
<U+FB01>nance documentation, which would in turn lead to DCL's bankruptcy. DCL's
bankruptcy would in turn trigger calls under the States' guarantees and result in maj or
shocks for the European <U+FB01>nancial system and the States.

18. According to SFPI/FPIM, its request is justi<U+FB01>ed, among other reasons, in View of the
following considerations:

(i) The destruction of the value of remaining assets. The liquidation of DeXia would
be value destructive. A liquidator appointed at the general meeting and con<U+FB01>rmed by
the commercial court of Brussels, would pay off DeXia's debts and sell all remaining
assets. Given the nature and illiquidity of such assets (primarily, but not exclusively,

DeXia’s stake in DCL), such sales would only be possible with substantial price
reductions under the current market conditions. Furthermore, the liquidation would
lead to a negative result meaning that no distributions could be made to the
shareholders.

(ii) Losses for creditors and serious systemic conseguences. The liquidation of
DeXia would have serious systemic consequences. Such a liquidation would
jeopardise the entire DeXia group, in particular DCL. Given that DCL has a
receivable of EUR 1.6 billion Vis-a-Vis DeXia and is the bene<U+FB01>ciary of guarantees
from DeXia of EUR 1,942 million worth of Greek securities (as of 30 September
2012), the liquidation of DeXia would mean that DCL would need to book an

5 This approach is similar to the one taken at recital 25 of the Commission's Decision in Case No
COMP/M.5508 - SOFFIN/HYPO REAL ESTATE

4


impairment on the entire value of its receivable. DCL would then have insuf<U+FB01>cient
net assets. Moreover, a default by the DeXia group would lead, Via the cross default
and acceleration provisions in the loans of certain entities of the group (mainly
DCL), to its entire debt becoming due. Such a default would jeopardise the stability
of the whole European financial system. A default by the DeXia group would also
severely destabilise the sovereign debt markets, in particular those of the Euro zone.
(iii) The employment oonseguenoes. Finally the liquidation of the DeXia group — and
the resulting bankruptcy of DCL — would have a severe negative impact in terms of
employment. The DeXia group employed approximately 3,600 people in Belgium
and France on 30 June 2012.

IV. THE CONDITIONS FOR DEROGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 7(3) OF

THE MERGER REGULATION

19. Pursuant to Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation, a concentration falling under that
Regulation shall not be implemented either before its notification or until it has been
declared compatible with the common market. Pursuant to Article 7(3) of the Merger
Regulation, the Commission may, on the basis of a reasoned request, grant derogation
from the obligation imposed by Article 7(1).

20. Derogation from the obligation to suspend concentrations is granted only
exceptionally, normally in circumstances where the suspension obligation required
under the Merger Regulation would cause serious damage to the undertakings
concerned by a concentration, or to a third party.

21. In deciding upon the request, the Commission must take into account, inter alia, the
effects of the suspension on one or more undertakings concerned by the concentration
or on a third party and the threat to competition posed by the concentration.

A. THE TRANSACTION FALLS UNDER THE SUSPENSION OBLIGATION
PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 7 (1) OF THE MERGER REGULATION

22. Given that the proposed transaction appears, on the basis of the information provided
by the Notifying Party, to constitute a concentration with EU dimension within the
meaning of the Merger Regulation, it falls under the suspension obligation laid down
in Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation.

B. THE EFFECTS OF THE SUSPENSION ON THE UNDERTAKINGS
CONCERNED AND THIRD PARTIES

23. According to the information provided by SFPI/FPIM, the application of the
suspension obligation in accordance with Article 7(1) of the Merger Regulation
would mean that DeXia could not be reoapitalised in a rapid and adequate manner,
which would run counter to the commitments required by the Commission pursuant
to the State aid proceedings. If derogation is not granted, the voting rights attached to
the preference shares for the Belgian and French States could not be exercised for a
period of at least 25 working days and the accompanying operational risks would be
very likely to severely damage DeXia, the DeXia group and the wider <U+FB01>nancial
community.

5


24. The Commission considers that the derogation appears appropriate as otherwise there
may be a considerable effect on DeXia, on its creditors and its employees, as well as
on the stability of the whole European financial system. A default by the DeXia group
would lead, Via the cross default and acceleration provisions in the loans of certain
entities of the group (mainly DCL), to its entire debt becoming due. On 30 September
2012, this amounted to approximately EUR 386.5 billion and, furthermore, a notional
amount of approximately EUR 605 billion in connection with derivatives.
Consequently, the DeXia group's unsecured creditors, and primarily those of DCL,
would suffer significant losses in respect of the receivables against the group. Indeed,
a default by the DeXia group would lead to assets being frozen in the short term and
would affect the liquidity of the markets, with possibly a signi<U+FB01>cant risk of spill over
to the rest of the Euro zone. This is due to the size of the group’s balance sheet, the
signi<U+FB01>cance of unsecured amounts outstanding, the volume of derivative agreements
entered into by entities of the DeXia group and banking oounterparties and the major
impact of the sale by the entities of the DeXia group of their bond portfolios on the
<U+FB01>nancial markets following the depreciation of the value of the bonds portfolio on a
mark to market basis.

25. A default by the DeXia group would also risk severely destabilising the sovereign debt
markets, in particular those of the Euro zone. The DeXia group entities held a
sovereign bond portfolio of EUR 20.049 billion as of 30 September 2012. The
liquidation of this portfolio would risk destabilising secondary markets, including
those of several Euro zone countries (more than 70% of this sovereign bond portfolio
is linked to States in the Euro zone). This could have a significant snowball effect on
<U+FB01>nancial markets.

26. Moreover, a default by the DeXia group would lead to a call on the guarantees granted
by the Belgian, French and Luxembourg States on 9 October 2008 for funding raised
by DCL, DBB and BIL, and on 16 December 2011 for funding issued by DeXia and
DCL. The total outstanding amounts guaranteed under the guarantee arrangements of
2008 and 2011 amounted to EUR 73.4 billion on 30 November 2012.

27. In addition, in the current circumstances and according to the information submitted
by SFPI/FPIM, there is a risk that the shareholders present at the meeting on 21
December 2012 will accept the capital increase while refusing the amendments to the
governance structure. On the basis of the information submitted by SFPI/FPIM, the
current shareholders will, in this meeting, vote on both the capital increase and the
accompanying necessary amendments to the governance structure. Should the
shareholders present at the meeting on 21 December refuse the amendments to the
governance structure, a general meeting of shareholders will need to be convened
immediately after the capital increase. At this meeting, the Belgian and French States
— by then holding together 94% of the shares — will approve the new governance
structure. In these circumstances, the Parties have indicated that the Belgian state
would be unwilling to commit to the recapitalization unless it were guaranteed also
the ability to adopt the new governance structure (and accordingly appoint DeXia's

6


board members). In the absence of this ability, the French State, notwithstanding
being the smaller shareholder, would be able to exercise its own voting rights, which
albeit on a temporary basis, would confer sole control of DeXia.. As such, a
derogation from the standstill obligation is an essential precondition for the required
recapitalisation.

28. Furthermore, on the basis of the information submitted by SFPI/FPIM, derogation
from the stand-still obligation would not have adverse effects on any third party, such
as consumers, clients of the DeXia group, other <U+FB01>nancial institutions (and their
clients), creditors and various Member States. Indeed, according to SFPI/FPIM the
Transaction would in fact have positive effects for these third parties insofar as the
potential negative effects of not granting the derogation (i.e. the destruction of value
of remaining assets, losses for creditors with severe negative consequences for the
wider <U+FB01>nancial system and negative consequences for employees within the DeXia
group) would be avoided. Therefore, the bene<U+FB01>ts <U+FB02>owing from the derogation
considerably outweigh any potential adverse effects that it may have on any of the
Parties or third parties.

29. Against this background, it is possible to conclude that the suspension obligation
imposed by Article 7(1) could lead to serious harm to DeXia while no negative effects
are likely to arise in relation to third parties from providing a derogation from this
obligation.

C. THE THREAT TO COMPETITION POSED BY THE CONCENTRATION

30. On the basis of the information submitted by SFPI/FPIM, it can be concluded that the
horizontal overlaps are very limited and that the vertical relationships do not raise,
primafacie, any issue of foreclosure.

31. The parties” actiVities in the banking sector are largely complementary. SFPI/FPIM is
active in retail banking in Belgium through its 100% controlling stake in Bel<U+FB01>us,
whereas the DeXia group no longer has any signi<U+FB01>cant presence in retail or corporate
banking in Belgium. Its main actiVities relate to <U+FB01>nancial services to the public sector
outside of Belgium, e.g. public bonds and proj ect <U+FB01>nance, principally in France.

32. The investment portfolio of SFPI/FPIM consists of various stakes in several
undertakings deemed of strategic interest to the Belgian State, including in the
banking sector in the wake of the <U+FB01>nancial crisis (controlling stake in Bel<U+FB01>us and
minority 10% stake in BNP Paribas).

33. In addition, DeXia is a <U+FB01>nancial institution which will be in run off in accordance with
the Revised Orderly Resolution Plan as approved by the Commission. As such, it will
have no long-term and Viable competitive presence in any of the markets it operates
on.

34. The parties' actiVities only overlap in a very limited way in the market for <U+FB01>nancial
services to the public sector, in both Belgium and France. However, both in Belgium
and France, the transaction would only lead to a very minor increment in this
segment.

35. As regards potential vertical effects, the transaction is not expected to lead to any
substantive issues. DeXia is active in asset management through its subsidiary DeXia

7


Asset Management ("DAM"), Which Will be divested before 31 December 2013 in
line With the Revised Orderly Resolution Plan. Although Bel<U+FB01>us distributes some
investment products (e.g. mutual funds and pension funds) that are managed by
DAM, Bel<U+FB01>us is not itself active in asset management. These activities are so limited,
however, that this vertical relationship is not expected to lead to any foreclosure
issues.

36. Therefore, on the basis of the information provided by SFPI/FPIM it appears prima
facie that the transaction is not likely to pose a threat to competition Within the EEA.

D. BALANCE OF INTERESTS

37. Based on the above, it appears that Whilst the suspension obligation could seriously
affect the <U+FB01>nancial situation of DeXia and the DeXia group along With the Wider
<U+FB01>nancial community, no threat to competition caused by the operation can currently
be identi<U+FB01>ed, and a derogation from the standstill obligation does not appear to have
adverse effects on one or more of the parties or on any third party.

38. Therefore the Commission <U+FB01>nds that a derogation from the suspension obligation can
be granted in accordance With the application.

39. The present derogation is granted on the basis and explicit understanding that the
concentration Will be noti<U+FB01>ed to the Commission pursuant to article 4 0f the Merger
Regulation Without delay.

V. CONCLUSION

40. The Commission considers that the reasons given for derogation from the suspension
obligations meet the requirements set out in Article 7(3) of the Merger Regulation.

41. On the basis of the above considerations, and in accordance With Article 7(3) of the
Merger Regulation, SFPI/FPIM is granted a derogation from the obligations imposed
by Article 7 (1) 0f the Merger Regulation in accordance With its application and until
the Commission takes a <U+FB01>nal decision under the relevant provisions of the Merger
Regulation.
