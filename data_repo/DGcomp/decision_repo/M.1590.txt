 general description.                                                   ARTICLE 6(1)(b) DECISION
                                                                     To the notifying party
Dear Sirs,
Subject: Case No IV/M. 1590 – HSBC/RNY/SAFRA
             Notification of 31.5.1999 pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation
             No 4064/89
1.     On 31 May 1999, the Commission received a notification of a proposed
       concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/891 by
       which HSBC Holdings plc (“HSBC”) acquires within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b)
       of the Council Regulation control of Republic of New York Corporation (“RNYC”)
       and Safra Republic Holdings S.A. (“SRH”).
2.     After examination of the notification, the Commission has concluded that the
       notified operation falls within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89
       and does not raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market
       and with the functioning of the EEA Agreement.
I.     THE PARTIES AND THE OPERATION
3.     HSBC is the holding company of one of the world’s largest banking and financial
       services organisations operating world-wide under well-established names such as
1    OJ L 395, 30.12.89 p. 1; corrected version OJ L 257 of 21.9.1990, p. 13; as last amended by
     Regulation (EC) No 1310/97, OJ L 180, 9.7.1997, p. 1, corrigendum in OJ L 40, 13.2.1998, p. 17.
Rue de la Loi 200, B-1049 Bruxelles/Wetstraat 200, B-1049 Brussel - Belgium
Telephone: exchange 299.11.11
Telex: COMEU B 21877. Telegraphic address: COMEUR Brussels.

     Hang Seng Bank, Hongkong Shanghai Bank, Midland Bank and others. RNYC is
     the holding company of, and its principal asset is, Republic National Bank of New
     York, a full service commercial bank headquarted in the United States. The RNYC
     group engages in five principal lines of business: private banking, consumer
     financial services, lending, global treasury and global markets. RNYC also owns a
     49.07% participation in SRH, a holding of banks engaged principally in private
     banking in a number of Member States and in Switzerland.
4.   By a transaction agreement and plan of merger dated 10 May 1999 it was agreed that
     a whole owned subsidiary of HSBC would merge with RNYC. HSBC would
     become the sole shareholder of RNYC as the surviving corporation. As part of the
     Merger Agreement, HSBC agreed to make an offer for the outstanding shares of
     common stock of SRH not owned by RNYC
II. CONCENTRATION
5.   The acquisition constitutes a single operation for the purpose of Council Regulation
     4064/89 [it relates to SRH’s control]. Through the proposed concentration, HSBC
     will acquire sole control of RNYC and SRH within the meaning of Article 3 of the
     Merger Regulation.
III. COMMUNITY DIMENSION
6.   The combined aggregate worldwide turnover of the undertakings concerned
     exceeded 5,000 million EURO in the last financial year (HSBC: 18,989.56 million
     EURO; RNYC: 4,332 million EURO). Each of them has a Community-wide
     turnover in excess of ECU 250 million (HSBC, EURO 7,969.92 million; and
     RNYC, EURO 387 million), but they do not achieve more than two-thirds of their
     aggregate Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State. The
     notified operation therefore has a Community dimension. It does not constitute a
     co-operation case under the EEA Agreement, pursuant to Article 57 of that
     Agreement.
IV. COMPATIBILITY WITH THE COMMON MARKET
     A.Relevant product markets
7.   Following the practice of the Commission assessing cases in the banking sector,
     there are three major market segments: retail banking, corporate banking and
     international financial products. RNYC and SRH are principally active in Europe in
     private banking, corporate and money market services and any effects of the
     transaction are therefore limited to these activities.
8.   However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
     product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
     does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
     competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of
     that area.
     B. Relevant geographic markets
                                                 2

9.  The notifying party states that the relevant geographic markets are either national or
    international in scope depending on the sector.
10. However, in the present case it is not necessary to conclusively define the relevant
    product markets because, even on the narrowest market definition, the concentration
    does not create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective
    competition would be significantly impeded in the EEA or any substantial part of
    that area.
    C. Competitive assessment
11. HSBC’s main banking market in Europe is the UK. According to British Banking
    Association data, HSBC has 8.83% of the assets of the whole UK banking system,
    8.5% of its deposits and 8.6% of its credits. RNYC is a minor player in that market
    with corresponding shares below 0.25%. The activities in other Member States are
    very limited and market shares and overlaps are negligible.
12. Consequently, the proposed concentration does not create or strengthen a dominant
    position as a result of which effective competition would be significantly impeded in
    the EEA or any substantial part of that area.
VI. CONCLUSION
13. For the above reasons, the Commission has decided not to oppose the notified
    operation and to declare it compatible with the common market and with the EEA
    Agreement. This decision is adopted in application of Article 6(1)(b) of Council
    Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89.
